# Ministry Guide: Sermons, Summaries, and Weekly Prayer Points

Welcome! This guide explains—in simple terms—where things are and how to use them. No tech skills required.

## What you'll find here

- Sermon transcripts (full text of messages)
- Sermon summaries (key points, scriptures, and a short overview)
- Weekly prayer points (organized by week and focus)
- Slide presentations you can show in church or on a projector

## Where things live

- Sermon transcripts: `transcripts/sermon/`
- Sermon summaries: `sermons_summaries/`
- Weekly prayer points: `prayer_points/` (by year)
- Slide presentations (HTML files): `presentations/` or in the main folder
- PDF handouts and exports: `output/`

If you don’t see a folder, it may not be created yet. Ask the team or create it when needed.

## How to open slides

Slides are regular files that open in a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).

1. Find the slide file, for example: `Have_I_Not_Called_You_Presentation.html`
2. Double-click it, or right-click and “Open With” your browser
3. Use your keyboard to move through slides:
   - Next: Right Arrow, Space, or Enter
   - Previous: Left Arrow
   - First slide: Home key
   - Last slide: End key

Tip: Press F11 (Windows) or use full-screen in the browser for a clean presentation look.

## How to print slides to PDF

You can make a PDF from the slides for sharing or printing.

1. Open the slide file in your browser
2. Open the browser menu and choose Print
3. Set “Destination” to “Save as PDF”
4. Click Save and choose a folder (use `output/` if possible)

## Weekly prayer points

- Each week has a short list of prayer topics with Bible verses
- Files are named by date so you can find them easily
- Example folder: `prayer_points/2025/Week-2025-09-15.md`

What to do with them:

- Read them during prayer time (midweek or Sunday)
- Share them with prayer teams or small groups
- Copy a few points into the slides if needed

## Sermon transcripts and summaries

- Transcript: the full message text
- Summary: the main idea, key scriptures, and action steps

Use summaries to:

- Create slides quickly
- Share a quick review with the congregation or teams
- Prepare small group questions

## Keeping things consistent

- Use clear names: “Title__Speaker_YYYY-MM-DD”
- Add scriptures in-line (e.g., John 3:16)
- Keep summaries short and focused on the main idea
- Save PDFs in the `output/` folder so they’re easy to find later

## Need help?

- Can’t find a file? Try using the search in your editor or ask a team member
- Unsure how to format something? Look at a recent example and copy the style
- Want new slides from a summary? Duplicate a previous slide deck and edit the text

We’re building a simple, useful library to serve the church each week. Thank you for helping keep it organized and easy to use!

**Series**: Unfailing Love

## Main Theme

This transformative message reveals the practical pathway for believers to walk in and experience God's love daily through four essential keys: Awareness, Acknowledgment, Abiding, and Action. The sermon establishes that eternal life is not merely a future promise but a present reality that empowers believers with the divine capacity to love as Christ loves.

## Central Message

God has already equipped every believer with the capacity to walk in supernatural love through the gift of eternal life dwelling within them. This eternal life represents God's very nature, ability, and power imparted to the human spirit at salvation. Just as biological life energizes the physical body to function, eternal life energizes the spirit to operate in the likeness of Christ, particularly in the area of love.

The key to experiencing and expressing this love is not trying harder through human effort, but learning to release and walk in the love already present within through the Holy Spirit. The sermon provides a practical, grace-based framework that moves believers from understanding God's love to actively expressing it in daily life.

## Key Theological Points

### 1. Eternal Life as Present Reality
Eternal life is not just a future promise but God's very life, nature, and ability imparted to your spirit when you became born again. This life energizes your spirit to function as God designed, enabling you to walk in love and be conformed to Christ's image. As 1 John 5:11 declares, "God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."

### 2. The Divine Capacity to Love
The love of God has been shed abroad in believers' hearts through the Holy Spirit. This means the capacity to love as Christ loves is already present within every believer. We have passed from death to life because we love the brothers (1 John 3:14), proving that God-kind love flows from the divine life within us.

### 3. God's Extreme Love for Us
God loves us with the same intensity that He loves Jesus Christ. This truth, found in John 15:9, reveals the unfathomable nature of God's love that surpasses human understanding. God demonstrated this extreme love by giving His only begotten Son for us (John 3:16), showing that He values us beyond measure.

### 4. Grace-Based, Not Performance-Based Living
Walking in love is not about trying harder or working harder through human strength. It's about abiding in Christ's love, relying on the love already within us, and allowing Christ to love others through us. This represents a fundamental shift from performance-based Christianity to grace-based living.

## The Four Keys to Walking in God's Love

### Key #1: AWARENESS
**"I see how much God loves me, and I continue to grow every day in my awareness of that love."**

Awareness involves developing a deep, personal revelation of God's love and how much He loves you. Ignorance of God's love hinders our ability to walk in it, like having heat available but freezing because you don't know it's there.

**How to Grow in Awareness:**
- Pray daily for increased revelation of God's love (Ephesians 3:19)
- Pray for others to experience deeper revelation of God's love
- Pray in the Spirit to keep yourself in the love of God (Jude 1:20-21)
- Read and meditate on scriptures about God's love
- Focus on passages like John 15:9 (God loves you as He loves Jesus), John 16:27 (the Father Himself loves you), and John 3:16 (God so loved the world)

**Application:** This awareness must continually increase through prayer, meditation, and Holy Spirit revelation.

### Key #2: ACKNOWLEDGMENT
**"I agree with and confess what God says about His love for all of His children, including me."**

Acknowledgment means opening your mouth to confess your agreement with what Scripture says about God's love. According to Philemon 1:6, our faith becomes effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing we have in Christ Jesus.

**The Power of Confession:**
- What you agree with, you activate
- Confession releases what grace has already provided
- Your words flip the switch that releases God's love from your spirit
- Vocal acknowledgment gives your spirit permission to release its contents
- Confession activates the love of God to work through you

**Application:** Regularly declare God's love for you, even when feelings disagree. Your confession releases the love already present in your spirit.

### Key #3: ABIDING
**"I rely on His love for me. I rely on His love in me for everything."**

Abiding means making God's love your permanent dwelling place, remaining anchored in the revelation of His love regardless of circumstances. Jesus commands in John 15:9, "Abide in my love" - not try harder, but simply remain.

**What Abiding Looks Like:**
- Staying in the revelation of God's love without allowing anything to move you
- Refusing to doubt God's love regardless of circumstances
- Relying totally on God's love for all answers to prayer
- Depending on God's love within you for your ability to love others
- Returning to the source when you feel empty or dry, without condemnation

**Practical Expressions:**
- Morning: "Father, thank You that You love me the same way You love Jesus. I receive and rely on this love today."
- In difficult situations: "Lord, I cannot do this in my strength. I rely on Your love in me to flow through me right now."
- When facing difficult people: "Lord, I'm depending on You to love this person through me."

**Key Distinction:** You don't love others FOR God; you love others THROUGH God.

### Key #4: ACTION
**"I allow His love to flow freely through me to others. I allow Christ to love through me."**

Action involves the decision to let God's love flow through you in tangible ways to others. Jesus commands in John 15:12, "Love one another as I have loved you" - a love that surpasses our human capacity and calls us to rely on Him to love through us.

**How Love Flows in Action:**
- Not forced, but freely flowing from abiding
- Manifests as patience, kindness, mercy, and other fruits of the Spirit
- Expressed through forgiveness, generosity, service, and how we speak
- Makes God visible to the world
- Demonstrated through practical daily interactions

**Forgiveness as Key Action:**
When struggling to forgive, abide in this revelation: "This person is loved by God as much as He loves Jesus." This truth, when meditated upon, transforms hearts and releases God's love to flow freely.

**The Flow Pattern:** Freely receive, freely give. The same love received must flow through you to others.

## Powerful Illustrations

### The Cold Apartment
The pastor shared a personal story from 1990-1991 when he and his wife slept cold in their first apartment, bundled in blankets, not knowing heat was available through a thermostat on the wall. They assumed heat was controlled externally, when in reality they could have been comfortable had they known and activated what was already available. This perfectly illustrates how believers can "freeze" spiritually without awareness and activation of God's love already present within them.

### Flipping the Switch
Just as electrical appliances won't work until you flip the switch, even though electricity is available, God's love won't flow through your life until you activate it through acknowledgment and confession. You can have all the spiritual resources available but benefit from none if you don't "flip the switch" through your words.

### Eternal Life as Fuel
What gasoline does for a car, what jet fuel does for an airplane, what blood does for the body - eternal life does for your spirit. It's the divine energy source that enables your spirit to function in the likeness of Christ.

## The Gospel Connection

The sermon concludes with a clear gospel presentation, inviting those who haven't received Christ to pray:

"Jesus, I thank You for the love You have for me. I am a sinner. I cannot save myself. And I certainly cannot love as You have loved me. Today, I confess that I need You. I need You as Savior. I need You as Lord. And today, I receive You as my Savior and as my Lord. Thank You for giving Your life for me. And today by faith, I accept Your life in me."

Those who pray this prayer receive forgiveness of sins, Christ comes into their heart, and they possess the life and love of Christ. They are then encouraged to immediately begin applying the Four Keys: grow in awareness, acknowledge it with their lips, rely on that life and love, and let it flow through them to others.

## Conclusion

This sermon provides a comprehensive, practical framework for experiencing and expressing God's love daily. It shifts the focus from human effort to divine enablement, from trying harder to abiding deeper, from performance to relationship. The Four Keys provide an easy-to-remember, immediately actionable approach that transforms theoretical knowledge of God's love into experiential reality.

The ultimate goal is not just personal blessing but making God visible to the world through our love for one another. As Jesus said, the world will know we are His disciples by our love - a love that flows not from our own strength but from the eternal life and divine love dwelling within us through the Holy Spirit.

Walking in God's love is not about striving but about receiving, not about producing but about releasing, not about working harder but about relying deeper on the One who is love and who loves through us.

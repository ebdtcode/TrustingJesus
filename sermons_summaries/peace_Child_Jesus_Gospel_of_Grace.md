Sermon Summary: Peace With God Through Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1–2)

The DMV needs the gospel, and Romans grounds us in the foundation of our faith: having been justified by faith, we now have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, we have access by faith into the grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. The “peace child” story illustrates the gospel: God gave His Son as our Peace Child. As long as Jesus lives (and He lives forever), everyone who receives Him lives in a state of peace with God. This peace is more than the end of hostility—it means God is positively for us.

Romans 8 unfolds the implications: If God is for us, who can be against us? He did not spare His own Son; therefore He will freely give us all things. God is the One who justifies; it is not God who condemns. Christ died, rose again, is at God’s right hand, and intercedes for us—therefore there is no condemnation for those in Christ and nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. The prodigal son shows the Father’s heart: grace runs to meet us before the law can condemn, restoring us as if we never left.

This peace was secured legally. God did not set aside His law; He fulfilled it. The soul that sins must die; without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. Jesus’ sinless life, substitutionary death, shed blood, and resurrection satisfied the righteous demands of the law. The resurrection is heaven’s verdict that the sacrifice was accepted and we are justified. Our peace is not sentimental; it is legal—like a deed you can present from Scripture.

Peace with God also ushers us into grace. Grace does not license sin; it liberates from sin. We are dead to sin; grace unites us to Christ and empowers holiness. Grace works in us to will and to do God’s good pleasure, teaching us to say “no” to ungodliness and transforming us from the inside out. We access all of this by faith—empty hands receiving all Christ has accomplished. This revelation reshapes how we see ourselves, others, our trials, and even death, and it propels us to share this good news with others.

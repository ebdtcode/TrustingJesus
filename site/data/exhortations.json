    "summary": "This exhortation challenges believers to understand that God's purpose in calling us to give is not primarily about receiving blessings, but about transforming us into the image of Christ. It addresses two extremes: giving to get blessed, and not giving because we feel we already have enough. True biblical giving reflects Christ's sacrificial love and transforms the giver's character.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "God's primary goal is to make us into the image of His Son, not merely to bless us",
      "We should not give to gain blessings or out of need, but to become like Christ",
      "The church in the West faces the Laodicean danger of self-sufficiency",
      "Jesus gave knowing many would not respond - we are called to the same sacrificial generosity",
      "Giving detaches our hearts from material things and attaches us to the Lord"

    "speaker": "Pastor",
    "scripture": "Romans 5:1-2",
    "summary": "A powerful message about Jesus as the Peace Child who legally secured our peace with God. The sermon emphasizes that salvation is not emotional but legal - Christ satisfied every requirement of the law. Using the prodigal son story, it illustrates how God treats believers as though they never sinned, never rebelled, never left home.",

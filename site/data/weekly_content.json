        "summary": "Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson launches 2026 as the 'Year of God's Unfailing Love,' declaring that God's love is the strongest, most powerful force in the universe. The core revelation is that love and faith function as heaven's 'dynamic duo' - love provides, faith receives and releases. Faith is activated by walking in love (giving, serving, sacrificing) and speaking with our mouths - 'we believe, therefore we speak.'",

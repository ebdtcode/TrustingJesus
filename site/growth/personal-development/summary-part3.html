            <h2>Core Theme</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>The Central Truth</h4>
                <p><strong>Becoming IS winning.</strong> Who you become determines what you win. The kind of person who wins is the kind of person you choose to become.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This part focuses on mindset transformation rather than strategic planning because "most of the time, people put a lot of things on paper but they don't do it." What you put on paper won't happen by itself. <strong>You make things happen.</strong></p>

            <hr>

            <h2>The Central Paradox: Freedom and Chosen Slavery</h2>

            <h3>1 Corinthians 9:19</h3>
            <p><em>"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all"</em></p>

            <div class="two-cols">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                    <p><strong>"I am free"</strong></p>
                    <p>What life has given to me naturally. Paul was a free Roman citizen - unrestrained, not bound by obligation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>What I Have Made Myself</h4>
                    <p><strong>"I have made myself a servant"</strong></p>
                    <p>The effort I've put in to become something else. Paul <em>chose</em> to be enslaved.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"I am free to do whatever I want, but I choose to be a servant. What kind of mindset is that?"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Choosing Your Slavery</h2>

            <p><strong>Universal truth:</strong> Everybody is a slave to something. You must choose what kind of slave and whose slave you want to be.</p>

                        <li>Slave to football</li>
                        <li>Slave to fun</li>

                        <li>Slave to the Word of God</li>

                        <li>Slave to wisdom and learning</li>

            <h2>Marking Your Own Paper</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"You get to a point in life where nobody marks your paper for you. You mark your own paper."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>When no one is overseeing you, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose your own slavery</li>
                <li>Set your own standards</li>
                <li>Push yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>"I study because I am a slave to learning. I'm a slave to quality. I'm a slave to excellence. I'm a slave to integrity. I'm a slave to honor. I have enslaved myself because if you don't enslave yourself, you're always going to require somebody else to oversee your life."</em></p>

            <h2>What Winning Really Means</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Become the person God wants me to be</strong> (self-actualization, character transformation)</li>

            <h2>The Transformation Sequence</h2>

            <div class="card" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
                <p><strong>MINDSET</strong> &rarr; <strong>BEING</strong> &rarr; <strong>DOING</strong> &rarr; <strong>HAVING</strong></p>
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The greatest change that must happen will not happen in your hands. It happens in your head before it comes into your hand."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>On poverty mindset:</strong> "If you have a poverty mindset, no matter how much money you are thrown into - if you are thrown into an ocean of money - you still come out poor, because it doesn't start with money. It starts with a mindset."</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Paul's Two Routines</h2>

            <h3>1. Repeated Thoughts</h3>
            <p><strong>The thought loop:</strong> "I must become, I must win. I must become, I must win."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marriage problems: "I must become a better husband so I can win"</li>
                <li>Leadership challenges: "I must become a better leader so I can win"</li>
                <li>Any struggle: "I must become better. I must improve. I must learn more."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>"It's so easy to complain without becoming."</em></p>

            <h3>2. Repeated Actions</h3>
            <p><strong>The action loop:</strong> "I keep running. I keep fighting."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If it's tough: I keep running and I keep fighting</li>
                <li>I don't quit because I keep running and I keep fighting</li>
                <li>It's called routine - the running routine, the fighting routine</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>Life Can Be Overcome</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you by life, you can choose differently."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li>You didn't choose your mother, but you choose your lifestyle</li>
                <li>You didn't choose your village, but you choose your values</li>
                <li>You didn't choose your poverty, but you choose your pursuit</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>"Life is hard. If anybody tells you the opposite, tell them they haven't lived yet. It's hard, but it is livable. We can overcome."</em></p>

            <h2>Power Quotes</h2>

            <blockquote><p>"The person who makes things happen is you. It's you. It's not what you have on paper."</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>"I must choose whose slave I become. Everybody is a slave to something."</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>"You are what you choose to be. I am making myself what I want to be."</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>"Many of us are pursuing things. But in life, we should pursue being. Because if you pursue being, being will get the things."</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>"Don't measure the plan for your life by acquisitions. You measure it by fulfillment and significance."</p></blockquote>

            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

            <p>I'm doing the third in my series "Developing a Plan for My Life." The subtitle is "Becoming and Winning."</p>

            <p>The reason I'm preaching this message, as I've said earlier, is that 10 years ago, in 2014, I preached messages leading to developing a 20-year plan. I encouraged each one of us to have a 20-year plan for our lives - what we want to do for the next 20 years of our lives, from 2014 to 2034.</p>

            <p>And 2024 is the mid-term review. This is 10 years after the 20-year plan. If you started it, it's to encourage you to go back and rework your plan. If you didn't have the opportunity to have a plan, this will give you the opportunity. When I conclude the series, I will put out a small document that you can take. It will help give you a foundation and guidance for you to have a plan for your life.</p>

            <p>This time we are looking at a 10-year plan from 2024 to 2034. Whether you like it or not, 2034 is going to come. Don't be like those people who never prepare for the rain and never buy raincoats. We're going to plan for the future. We're going to encounter the future. And we want to be ready when 2034 comes.</p>

            <h2 id="mindset">Why Mindset Matters More Than Strategy</h2>

            <p>Last week I spoke about moving from here to there. I tied it to Paul's mindset of pressing on and what God told Elijah about how to move from one place to the other. Today we will go a little bit more into Paul's mindset.</p>

            <p>You'll notice that since I started this series, I've focused more on mindset and philosophies of life rather than just strategic planning - "do this and do that and do that, plan A, plan B." Because most of the time, as I've come to know, people put a lot of things on paper but they don't do it. Even companies have strategic plans but they never materialize.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Because the person who makes things happen is you. It's you. It's not what you have on paper. What you put on paper is not going to happen by itself. You make things happen. And that's why I'm focusing more on our frame of mind, our philosophy of life, and the mindset we should have as we approach our 10-year plan.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="paul">The Apostle Paul's Character</h2>

            <p>The Apostle Paul was very intense in pressing. When he was committed to something, he was committed to it with all his being. He was not a half-and-half person. He is not "one foot in, one foot out" kind of a person. When he persecuted the early church, he did it with full intensity. And after he became a Christian, he evangelized with even more intensity. That is Paul. And he is the one we want to look at in our series.</p>

            <p>Paul was not a fatalist. He was not a humanist. He was a Biblicist. He believes that he could do all things through Christ. Not a humanist view of "I can do all things, I'm the captain of my life," but "I can do all things through Christ." With God, all things are possible.</p>

            <p>The Christian with a Biblicist mindset believes that God has a plan for my life. And God gives me the grace to fulfill the plan - and I have to work extremely hard to fulfill that plan.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="freedom">Who I Am vs. What I Have Made Myself</h2>

            <h3>1 Corinthians 9:19-22</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <p>"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more. To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law; to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law; to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."</p>
                <span class="ref">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</span>
            </div>

            <p>There are a couple of things I want you to note.</p>

            <h3>Who I Am</h3>

            <p>First, Paul talks about who he is. "Who I am" is what life has given to us. Each one of us can describe ourselves as to who we are. But this is how Paul says he is: He says "I am free."</p>

            <p>"I am free." This is who I am. I'm a free person - from the Greek word <em>eleutheros</em>. It means unrestrained, exempted, not bound by obligation. Paul says, "I am a free person. I am not a restricted person. I am not a restrained person. I am not a person who is under obligation to do what I do. I am free."</p>

            <p>The question is: If you are free, how do you live your life?</p>

            <h3>What I Have Made Myself</h3>

            <p>Then Paul makes a second statement, which is very important. He talks about what he has made himself.</p>

            <p>So there are two things: who I am and what I have made myself. "Who I am" is what life has given to me naturally. "What I have made myself" is the effort I have put in to become something else.</p>

            <p>Paul says "I am free." Then look at what he says: "I have made myself a servant." I have made myself a servant - from the Greek word <em>doulos</em>. It means to be enslaved, restricted, and to be under bondage.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Now, he didn't say people have made me a servant. He didn't say life has made me a servant. He didn't say my parents made me a servant or the Romans have made me a servant. He said, "I have made myself." I am free to do whatever I want, but I choose to be a servant.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>What kind of mindset is that? What kind of a person would say "I am free, and I am going to choose to live like a servant"?</p>

            <p>While many of us strive to make ourselves kings and queens and lords, Paul made himself the opposite. While many of us seek to raise ourselves, Paul chose the opposite.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Choosing Your Slavery</h2>

            <p>The lesson here is very simple: <strong>I must choose whose slave I become.</strong></p>

            <p>Everybody is a slave to something. Whether you like it or not, you are a slave to something. You must choose what kind of slave and whose slave you want to be. Most people are slaves to things they do not like or things that destroy them.</p>

            <p><strong>Some are slaves to sin.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Some are slaves to food.</strong> There are people who are slaves to food. They've got to eat. Sometimes people are slaves to a particular food. Even if their health or life depended on it, they are so enslaved by that particular practice that contrary to every medical advice, they will still practice what will kill them. People who are slaves to sugar - the doctor can say whatever, they will still eat sugar. People who are slaves to carbohydrates, to food and yam and all kinds of things. They may be told, "This is dangerous to your health," but they are so enslaved that they will still do it.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>You know you are a slave when you are doing something you know is not good for you but you keep doing it. You're a slave to something.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Some are slaves to football</strong> - especially the English Premier League.</p>

            <p><strong>Some are slaves to fun.</strong> They love fun.</p>

            <p><strong>Some are slaves to spending.</strong> No matter how much money they have, they are going to blow it - and shake their head while blowing it.</p>

            <h3>Choose Constructive Slavery</h3>

            <p>But you can also choose to be a slave to Christ. You can choose to be a slave to the Holy Spirit, a slave to the Word of God, a slave to righteousness, a slave to integrity, a slave to honor, a slave to wisdom.</p>

            <p>That means that no matter what happens, you're going to live for Christ and for the Holy Spirit and for wisdom, for honor, for integrity. That's the slave you have chosen to be.</p>

            <p>So Paul says, "Although I'm free, I have chosen my slavery."</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Marking Your Own Paper</h2>

            <p>So all of you who want to be free - God bless you. But after you are free, you have to choose your slavery.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>You get to a point in life where nobody marks your paper for you. You mark your own paper.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In much of my adult life, I have not been under anybody because I've been a senior pastor from when I was in my 20s. I was General of a denomination. Nobody marks me. Nobody demands anything from me. Nobody tells me when to wake up, what to preach, how to preach. Nobody tells me that. Nobody corrects me because in Ghana, when you are the boss, you are properly the boss.</p>

            <p>And there are people like that. You started your own company, you are the boss. You have nobody above you. And that's what Paul is saying: "I'm free, but I've chosen to be a slave."</p>

            <p>That means I don't wait for somebody to mark my paper for me to pass the exam or to study. I study because I am a slave to learning. I'm a slave to quality. I'm a slave to excellence. I'm a slave to integrity. I'm a slave to honor. I have enslaved myself.</p>

            <p>Because if you don't enslave yourself, you're always going to require somebody else to oversee your life.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Two Key Phrases in the Passage</h2>

            <p>When we look at Paul's writing, there are two phrases that occur repeatedly in this passage.</p>

            <h3>"I Became As"</h3>

            <p>The first one is "I became as." He's talking about his ability to self-transform. The phrase is used directly three times in the passage we read: "I became as... I became as... I have become." And it is implied two times. So you can say five times Paul uses the phrase "I became" in just a short passage of scripture.</p>

            <p>He's telling you: <strong>You are what you choose to be. I am making myself what I want to be.</strong></p>

            <h3>"That I Might Win"</h3>

            <p>The second phrase he uses repeatedly is "that I might win." You can say he had a winning mindset. In four verses he uses the phrase "that I might win." And if you include the phrase "that I might by all means save some," then we can say five times in this passage he says "that I might win."</p>

            <p>Five times "I have become." Five times "I must win."</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>The two are related.</strong> I'm going to win if I become. Becoming is winning. The kind of person who wins is the kind of person you choose to become.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <hr>

            <h2>Life Can Be Overcome</h2>

            <p>One of the things you're going to know in life is that life sometimes can be very difficult. I pay attention. Sometimes when I'm driving by the road and I see a woman carrying a baby and begging for food or money, I think about that baby. And I say, "How is this child going to change their lives? Look at what life has handed them - beggar by the roadside mother. At the time they should be going to school, they are not going to go to school."</p>

            <p>Can that child choose a different destiny from what the mother has imposed on them? Yes. That's the core of the Bible. <strong>The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you by life, you can choose differently.</strong></p>

            <p>Now people are going to tell you, "It's okay. Life is not fair. Nobody gave you a chance. You were not well treated." And they can make you settle for what life gave you.</p>

            <p>But Paul says, "I have become. I have made myself. Why? Because I want to win. I don't want to be a loser in life."</p>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="winning">What Winning Really Means</h2>

            <p>What does Paul talk about when he talks about winning? He talks about winning in the assignment that God gave him to reach out to people. So in Paul's mind, winning means two things:</p>

            <h3>1. Become the Person God Wants Me to Be</h3>

            <p>I must become the person God wants me to be. That's what we call self-actualization. I must become that.</p>

            <p>If God wants me to be righteous, then I'm not going to say, "Oh, my mother was a prostitute and gave birth to me. So I don't think I can ever live a righteous life." You can. Of course, you didn't choose your mother, but you can choose your lifestyle.</p>

            <p>Have you noticed that in life, some of the greatest achievers have come from the most disruptive backgrounds? If you listen to people's stories, you can't even know how they managed to get to where they are.</p>

            <h3>2. Do the Things God Wants Me to Do</h3>

            <p>Many times we think about things. So we're going to do a 10-year plan: "I want to make money." But if you have a poverty mindset, no matter how much money you are thrown into - if you are thrown into an ocean of money - you still come out poor. Because it doesn't start with money. It starts with a mindset.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Many of us are pursuing things. But in life, we should pursue being. Because if you pursue being, being will get the things. The greatest change that must happen will not happen in your hands. It happens in your head before it comes into your hand.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Winning means to do the things God wants me to do. To live life in such a way that you know "I have achieved," but the things I've achieved are meaningful.</p>

            <p>Everybody can achieve things in life. Everybody can build buildings. Most people can have money. Everybody can be famous. But that doesn't mean your life is meaningful. You can be famous and miserable. You can be rich and just miserable.</p>

            <p>Because <strong>the greatest achievement is not what you get - it's becoming and doing what God wants for your life.</strong> That's why we don't measure achievement with money and acquisitions. We measure achievement with fulfillment and significance.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>The Teacher Illustration</h2>

            <p>For some of you, you may be teachers and all you're going to do is teach class two or class three for the rest of your life. You may not build mansions. But if you are there transforming lives, bringing hope to children, and you do it faithfully, you will be a more happy, fulfilled, significant person than the person who built meaningless buildings and had almost zero positive contribution to anybody.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Don't measure the plan for your life by acquisitions. You measure it by fulfillment and significance. Being where God wants me to be. Doing what God wants me to do.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Of course, money is very important, and I know your ten-year plan is mostly going to be about money. And of course, make some money. But you make money basically so that you don't become a beggar or be controlled by another person. What you're looking for is financial freedom - not exactly wealth or riches, but just financial freedom.</p>

            <p>And if you should have riches, what are you going to do with it?</p>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="discipline">The Power of Discipline</h2>

            <h3>1 Corinthians 9:25-27</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <p>"And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown. Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified."</p>
                <span class="ref">1 Corinthians 9:25-27</span>
            </div>

            <h3>What Is Discipline?</h3>

            <p>The word discipline is used. And discipline is basically what I do and keep doing. Discipline is about routines.</p>

            <p>Routines sustain life. Our universe follows routines. Our planet follows routines. That's why we can predict eclipses or the arrival of comets - because there's a certain routine.</p>

            <p>Our bodies follow routines. Our heart beats, blood circulation, breathing - all of these things are disciplined actions.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Can you imagine if your heart says, "You know, I've been beating for so many years. I've been beating. I have no break. I have to go on vacation. I need to go to Dubai. Okay, okay, I'll just take about 10 minutes vacation." That's the end of you.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>But your heart beats in a routine constantly. Your blood circulation is a routine. That means that your life depends on routine. That's what discipline is. Discipline is doing something and continuing to do it.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Paul's Two Routines</h2>

            <p>Paul had a routine of life which he talks about in the passage. There's a routine about him. There's something about how he approached life, and it's in two things:</p>

            <h3>1. Repeated Thoughts</h3>

            <p>The first one is repeated thoughts. His thought is: "I must become, I must win. I must become, I must win. I must become, I must win."</p>

            <p>That's his mindset. If he faces a problem: "I must become, I must win."</p>

            <p>How are you going to deal with life? "I must become better. I must improve. I must improve. I must learn more. I must improve myself so that I can win."</p>

            <p>If Paul - he wasn't married, but if he was a husband and had a problem with his wife - he's not going to say, "My wife is a witch." He'd say, "I must become a better husband so I can win at this marriage thing."</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Because it's so easy to complain without becoming. It's very easy for a pastor to say, "My members must stop this!" Rather than saying, "I must become a better leader so I can win and lead this flock."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Many times, as General of a denomination, I talk with our pastors. And there are pastors who complain: "Pastor, you don't know what we go through on the ground. It's hard. You call the people, they don't come to church."</p>

            <p>I say, "I know that. They do the same for me too."</p>

            <p>But what I tell them is: "Is there another church in your community that is doing well?"</p>

            <p>They say, "Yeah, a new church came and everybody is going there."</p>

            <p>So you cannot say churches don't do well here because one is doing well. What you can say is: "There's something I haven't discovered yet. And I must become that so that I can do my job."</p>

            <p>Because if you don't have that mindset of "I must become in order to win," life will defeat you and you're going to make a lot of excuses.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Because believe me, life is hard. If anybody tells you the opposite, tell them they haven't lived yet. Life - as the Nigerians say - na wa, o! It's hard. It's hard, but it is livable. It is livable. We can overcome.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Paul says, "I must become. I must win." That's his repeated thought.</p>

            <h3>2. Repeated Actions</h3>

            <p>And then his repeated action. If you read the passage, he says: "I keep running. I keep fighting. I keep running. I keep fighting. I keep running. I keep fighting. I keep running. I keep fighting."</p>

            <p>That's my action. If I face it and it's tough: I keep running and I keep fighting. I don't quit because I keep running and I keep fighting. It's called routine. The running routine. The fighting routine.</p>

            <p>So what's your routine? You face an obstacle: "Ah, it's too hard. I don't think I can do it. Man came to do some. He didn't come to do all. Let me try my best." You have a weak mindset. You have to go back to the Bible.</p>

            <p>Paul says, "I become because I want to win, and I keep fighting and I keep running."</p>

            <p>If you're going to fulfill something meaningful, become somebody significant in the next 10 years - this is how you do it.</p>

            <p>The next time, we'll learn how to put this in a written form. So we can have a plan for our lives - to overcome and to be the best that God has for us. Amen.</p>

            <h3>Closing Prayer</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Father, we thank you that in your word we find a wisdom for life, the way to make our lives work. And I pray, Lord, for each one of us - myself included, for everybody here - help us Lord to have this becoming and winning mindset.</p>
                <p>That we will continue to be better versions of ourselves until we can say, "I am what God wants me to be." Our lives conform to your purposes and to your plans and to your will.</p>
                <p>And may we pursue things that are noble and righteous and things that bring honor to your name.</p>
                <p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.</p>

## Executive Summary

In this foundational message, Pastor Mensa Otabil addresses the fundamental question every Christian must answer: "To plan or not to plan?" This sermon lays the philosophical and theological groundwork for the entire series by examining three worldviews that shape how people approach life planning.

The teaching marks the beginning of a 10-year life planning initiative, building on a 20-year plan Pastor Otabil introduced in 2014. Now at the mid-point (2024), he's revisiting these principles to help each person develop an intentional plan for the next decade of their lives.

## Core Theme: THREE VIEWS OF LIFE

Pastor Otabil identifies three fundamental philosophies that govern how people approach life:

### 1. The Fatalist View
**Definition**: "Whatever will be will be"

**Characteristics**:
- Life has already been determined by fate, destiny, or God
- Passive approach to life
- Abandons personal responsibility
- Common among many religious people, including some Christians

**Key Quote**: *"My view is that a lot of Africans... live life from a fatalistic point of view. We believe that whatever will be will be. That is one of the main reasons why we are not able to improve our lives."*

**Problem**: Fatalism leads to passivity and prevents growth and change.

---

### 2. The Humanist View
**Definition**: "I can be whatever I want to be"

**Characteristics**:
- "I am the master of my destiny, the captain of my ship"
- No place for any external force (spiritual or otherwise)
- Common among atheists and agnostics
- Prevalent in Western self-help culture

**Key Quote**: *"This humanist view is not a new thing... it is a view that started from the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve... decided we can be God ourselves."*

**Biblical Examples**:
- Garden of Eden (Adam and Eve's rebellion)
- Tower of Babel (human self-determination)

**Problem**: Excludes God from life planning; prideful self-sufficiency.

---

### 3. The Biblicist View (The Ideal Christian Position)
**Definition**: "I choose what God wants for my life"

**Characteristics**:
- God has a plan for me, but I must actively participate
- Combines divine purpose with personal responsibility
- Based on understanding the Bible as God's revelation
- Neither passive (fatalist) nor self-sufficient (humanist)

**Key Quote**: *"The Biblicist view says God has a plan for me but I'm not passive in that plan. I must be active. I must do something about it."*

**Goal**: By the end of this series, develop a life plan from a Biblicist mindset.

## Jesus Christ on Planning

### The Apparent Contradiction

Pastor Otabil examines two passages that seem to give opposite instructions:

**Matthew 6:31-34 (Don't Worry)**
> "Do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear... do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about its own things."

**Luke 14:28-31 (Plan Ahead)**
> "For which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost whether he has enough to finish it?"

### The Resolution: Three Principles from Jesus

1. **Don't be preoccupied with the things you need**
   - Don't let your life consist of needs and ambitions
   - Avoid the "hustle" mentality where getting is everything
   - *"Don't just be a hustler who's just going around thinking about how do I get it"*

2. **Make God's will your priority and choice**
   - "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness"
   - God first, then things
   - Proper sequence: God > Things

3. **Plan adequately for the things you want**
   - Don't leave building your life to chance
   - Life is like a building requiring thousands of decisions
   - *"If you plan to build a house... don't you think your life is more important than a building?"*

## Biblical Wisdom on Planning: Proverbs 16

### Proverbs 16:2-3 - Motives and Commitment

**Principle 1**: We determine what we want
- *"All the ways of a man appear in his own eyes"*
- We see life as we see it, based on our experiences
- Someone born into poverty may have a deep drive to prosper

**Principle 2**: God examines and corrects our motives
- *"But the Lord weighs the spirit"*
- Even justified desires can be pursued wrongly
- God purifies our means of achieving goals

**Principle 3**: Commitment brings establishment
- *"Commit your works to the Lord and your thoughts will be established"*

---

### Proverbs 16:9 - Human Plans, Divine Direction

**What Man Does**: *"A man's heart plans his way"*
- We should not be afraid to initiate plans
- We cannot be passive about our lives
- Even without 100% certainty, still plan

**What God Does**: *"The Lord directs his steps"*
- God shows us what to do
- Opens doors we never saw
- Rearranges relationships
- Leads us into unexpected paths

**Key Quote**: *"I make my plan but God will order my steps. God will show me what to do. So there is a human responsibility as well as divine action. This is the Biblicist view."*

---

## How God Directs Our Steps

1. **By opening doors we never saw**
   - Plans may be achieved faster than expected
   - God orchestrates events

2. **By directing us into new relationships**
   - Bringing new people into our lives
   - Sometimes taking us away from certain people

3. **By rearranging people around us**
   - Not because others are bad
   - But because certain relationships may not serve your current season

---

## On Relationships and Progress

### The Danger of Sympathy

**Key Quote**: *"There are people who want to make you feel comfortable with your misery... That's a good sympathizer but at a certain point you don't need sympathy in life. You don't need sympathizers. You need people who say 'hey, let's stop, let's make it.' You need encouragers."*

**The Marathon Analogy**: A tired runner doesn't need people saying "you are tired" - they need people pushing them toward the finish line.

**Principle**: Sometimes sympathy can be your greatest enemy. Champions are made by coaches who push despite tiredness.

---

## The Danger of Seeking Prosperity "By Any Means"

**Warning**: Deep poverty can create such intense drive that people justify wrong methods.

**Key Quote**: *"You have suffered... so you can justify it. You can tell everybody the reason why you must get that one... because you have suffered. So what? That's what Proverbs says - a man's ways can be pure in his own sight."*

**Solution**: Submit to God's examination of motives. He will give righteous means to achieve legitimate goals.

## Power Quotes for Personal Development

1. **On Philosophy**: *"Whether you think you have a philosophy of life or not, you do. Each one of us have a way in which we approach life."*

2. **On Fatalism**: *"The fatalist view of life is largely a passive approach to life... you are not really doing anything about your life."*

3. **On Humanism**: *"The humanist view seems appealing because it's empowering... but we see more and more in the Bible that God opposes that view of life."*

4. **On The Biblicist View**: *"I choose what God wants for my life. God wants something for me but I also have to choose it."*

5. **On Planning**: *"Whether you plan or not you will grow... but what kind of grown do you want to be?"*

6. **On Poverty**: *"Most of us were born into poverty... one of the big drives of our lives is we want to prosper."*

7. **On Divine Direction**: *"Sometimes God opens doors we never saw... in two years it's done."*

8. **On Relationships**: *"At a certain point in your life, certain relationships may not be what you need for that level of your life. They're not bad people. They're good people. But they have a negative effect on you."*

9. **On Sympathy**: *"Sometimes all you need is somebody who doesn't feel your pain and tells you 'hey, get over it, get up and move on.' That's how champions are made."*

10. **On Certainty**: *"All of us at a certain level don't know what to do... The fact that you're not 100% sure does not mean don't plan."*

## Key Theological Framework

### The Balance of Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility

| Aspect | Divine Role | Human Role |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Purpose | God has a plan | We must discover and choose it |
| Direction | God directs steps | We must plan our way |
| Motives | God weighs the spirit | We must commit our works |
| Results | God establishes thoughts | We must initiate action |
| Relationships | God orchestrates | We must discern and respond |

## Common Objections Addressed

### "Many are the plans in a man's heart, but the Lord's purpose prevails"

**Wrong Interpretation**: "Don't plan because God will override anyway."

**Correct Understanding**: Plan intentionally, but hold plans loosely. God will refine, redirect, and fulfill His greater purposes through your faithful planning.

## The 10-Year Plan Context

**Background**: In 2014, Pastor Otabil initiated a 20-year life plan (2014-2034)
**Current Status**: 2024 is the midpoint
**New Initiative**: A focused 10-year plan (2024-2034)

**Testimonies**: Some church members returned to say everything they wrote 10 years ago has come to pass.

**Vision**: Each person should know where they want to be in 10 years
- Pastor Otabil: "10 years from now I'll be about 75 years old and I'll be a very young man at that time, still very active in the Lord."

---

## Prayer Focus

*"Father, we thank you that you know the end from the beginning. You are the Alpha and the Omega. You know our days. You command our days. You know our story and you know where you are taking us. We consciously bring ourselves into alignment with your will. We make ourselves available to think your thoughts, to plan with your mind. And help us, Lord, that as we build a life plan we'll do it with the right mindset so that the future of our lives will be greater than our past. In Jesus' name, Amen."*

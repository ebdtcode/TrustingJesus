## Introduction

Well, if you remember at the beginning of the year I indicated that this year 2024 is the 10th year of the 20-year plan. In 2014 I led the church and those of you who were there at the time 10 years ago to develop a life plan, a 20-year plan. And most of you did. Some of you probably forgot about your plan but somehow followed it. A few people have come to me and said, "Pastor, this is my plan and I have seen everything I wrote about 10 years ago come to pass."

So I decided that since we are in the mid-year of that 20-year plan, I will go back to that and I will teach, and then we would do a 10-year plan for each one of us. Each one of us is going to think about who we want to be, what we want to do in the next 10 years of our life.

I'm going to do a four-part teaching on that subject and at the end of it I will give you a document for each one of you to work your way and develop a life plan which you're going to follow for the next 10 years of your life. Just add 10 years to your life and you would know where you'll be. 10 years from now I'll be about 75 years old, and I'll be a very young man at that time, still very active in the Lord. So I need to think about what kind of 75-year-old I want to be.

My series is titled "Developing a Plan for My Life." This is Part One, and my subtitle is "To Plan or Not to Plan" - because many times that is the question we ask ourselves: Is it biblical for a Christian to plan for their lives? Is it biblical for a business to plan? Should we do that? Does it fit into what the Bible teaches?

## Three Philosophies of Life

### How People See Life

To address that, I will start by talking about how people see life - what we call our philosophy of life. Whether you think you have a philosophy of life or not, you do. Each one of us has a way in which we approach life.

I'm going to start talking about three fundamental ways that most people see their lives.

### 1. The Fatalist View

The first view people have is the fatalist view. These are people who would say "whatever will be will be." In other words, my life has already been determined by some power - whether it's fate or destiny or God. So nothing really matters. Whatever will be will be. You don't do anything about it - it's going to happen anyway.

Many kinds of people are fatalists. Most are religious people, including Christians. The fatalist view of life is largely a passive approach to life. You are not really doing anything about your life. You are just living it out and hoping that it ends somehow.

My view is that a lot of Africans - not all, but a lot of Africans - live life from a fatalistic point of view. We believe that whatever will be will be. That is one of the main reasons why we are not able to improve our lives. That's one reason why we're not able to change our countries and our lifestyles. Because when you have this mindset, you believe that whatever will be will be. Just leave it. The gods have decided it, or God has decided it, or fate has decided it. It's fixed and I can do nothing about it.

### 2. The Humanist View

The second view is what I call the humanist view. The humanist is opposite of the fatalist. The humanist view says "I can be whatever I want to be." This is the person who says "I am the master of my destiny, the captain of my ship" - as is clearly articulated in the words of the Invictus poem.

Such a person does not have a place for any external force, whether it's spiritual or any other view. They believe that they own their lives and they run their lives as they want. This is the way of most atheists and agnostics - people who don't believe in any kind of supernatural world. We see this view growing more and more in the modern world, in our self-help books and podcasts.

But this humanist view is not a new thing. It's not modern. It is a view that started from the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve - that's why they decided "we can be God ourselves." That's why they disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden. That's what happened at the Tower of Babel when the people said "we can determine our destiny."

The humanist view seems appealing because it's empowering. It tells people you can do all that you want to do. But we see more and more in the Bible that God opposes that view of life where we think we are the masters of our lives.

### 3. The Biblicist View

The third view is what I call the Biblicist view. It simply says: "I choose what God wants for my life." God wants something for me, but I also have to choose it.

The Biblicist view says God has a plan for me, but I'm not passive in that plan. I must be active. I must do something about it. I choose what God wants for my life.

The Biblicist is a person who sees the Bible as God's revelation to him or her, and as a result this person makes choices based on their understanding of the values of the Bible. This is the ideal Christian position - although many Christians do not hold a Biblicist view. A lot of Christians have a fatalist view or a humanist view. Very few Christians are intentionally living their lives according to the Bible.

The question you want to ask yourself is: Where do I fit in? Where is my mind in this? How do I live my life? Am I living from a fatalist view? Am I just a humanist trying to improve my life and I don't care about God? Or do I have a Biblicist view where I choose what I want to do but I also believe God has a purpose for my life?

## What Did Jesus Say About Planning?

Now let's get into the Bible. Let's start with Jesus Christ. What did Jesus say about our plans? Because ultimately, as Christians, everything we believe is based on Christ Jesus. If he opposes something, we cannot do it. But if he recommends something or commands something, we must do it.

### Matthew 6:31-34

The first passage is Matthew chapter 6, verses 31 to 34:

> "Therefore do not worry, saying 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own problem."

Particularly when you look at verse 34, you could get the impression that Jesus does not want us to plan ahead of time. He's saying don't worry about tomorrow - tomorrow would take care of itself. It seems to be like a fatalist view: whatever would be would be. Just take care of today, don't worry, be happy.

### Luke 14:28-31

But look at another statement of Jesus in Luke's gospel, chapter 14, verses 28 to 31:

> "For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it - lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.' Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"

If you read this, it seems like Jesus is telling us that we must plan ahead for the things we want to do. So in Matthew he's saying "don't worry about tomorrow." In Luke he's saying "plan for tomorrow." Where does the Christian place himself in these two extremes?

### Three Principles from Jesus

I've tried to summarize what Jesus is teaching with three statements:

**1. Don't be preoccupied with the things you need.** Don't let your life be occupied by the things you need - "I need clothes, I need money, I need a wife, I need a husband, I need children, I need to make it, I need to prosper." Don't be preoccupied. Don't let your life consist of your needs and your ambitions. Don't live a life that is always thinking about "how do I get it?" That's what we normally call "the hustle." Don't just be a hustler going around thinking about how to get it.

**2. Make God's will your priority and choice.** "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness." So don't let things be a priority - let God be a priority. There is a sequence: don't be preoccupied with the things you need, be occupied with God and His kingdom and His righteousness.

**3. Plan adequately for the things you want.** If you want a building, don't sit down and hope that the building will build itself. He says plan for it. Plan for what you want to have done in the future. Life is like a building - what are you building with your life? What do I want to achieve? Yes, I don't have to be preoccupied. Yes, I have to occupy myself with God. But I have to plan. I have to think about what I need, everything that is required for this building to be built up.

Now, if you plan to build a house, a building - don't you think your life is more important than a building? You cannot leave your life to chance. The next 10 years is coming whether you plan for it or not. Whether I plan for it or not, 10 years from now I'll be 75. I can slip my way to 75 and I'll still be 75. But I can also decide "this is what I want to achieve by 75" and work towards something. Whether you plan or not, you will grow. But what kind of grown do you want to be?

## How Do I Know My Plan Is God's Way?

The big question most Christians wrestle with is: If I'm going to plan, how am I going to be sure that this plan is God's way or not God's way? I want to plan something - how am I sure that this is the right plan to make for my life? There are no easy answers to that. I cannot tell you specifically that this plan is God's way or that plan is God's way, but I can give you guidelines from the Bible.

### Proverbs 16:2-3

The first passage is in Proverbs chapter 16, verses 2 and 3:

> "All the ways of a man appear pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits. Commit your works to the Lord, and your thoughts will be established."

This passage says two important things:

**First: We determine what we want.** "All the ways of a man appear pure in his own eyes." We live life as we see it. When we are making plans for our lives, we are making plans as we see it - as we see life, as we see our future.

If you are born into deep poverty - like most of us were, like most Ghanaians are - you may develop a deep desire in your heart to break out of poverty and be rich. Because that is the deep thing in our lives, we get preoccupied: what we eat, what we drink, what we wear. It's the most important thing in our minds. It's so strong that sometimes you don't care how you prosper.

A man's ways appear pure in his own eyes. I have seen people who steal from other people and justify it with their hardship. Or maybe you want a husband so much, you feel "I need to marry before I die," that you don't care whether you're taking somebody's husband or not - because you're driven by your need and it appears pure in your sight. You can justify it. You can tell everybody the reason why you must get that one because you have suffered. So what?

**Second: God examines and corrects our motives.** "But the Lord weighs the Spirit." In other words, God examines and corrects our motives. So we are having a plan, we want to prosper, but maybe because of our poverty we want to prosper at every cost - "by any means necessary." But are we going to fulfill our plans by any means necessary? No. The Bible says God examines and corrects our motives.

Sometimes you make a plan about what you want to be in the next 10 years and you put the things down, but God finds a way to correct your motives so that yes, the plan is clear, the vision is clear, but the means for getting it is now purified by God. He gives you righteous means by which you can get the things you want.

### Proverbs 16:9

The second scripture is Proverbs chapter 16, verse 9:

> "A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

So there is what man is doing and what God is doing.

**What Man Does:** "A man's heart plans his way." We make our plans. We should not be afraid to initiate plans for our lives. We cannot be passive about our lives. We must be intentional about what we want for our lives. Even if you are not fully sure, you must have a plan. Don't go through life saying "I don't know what to do" over and over. Yes, all of us at a certain level don't know what to do. I am not 100% sure about my life. You are not 100% sure about your life. The fact that you're not 100% sure does not mean don't plan.

**What God Does:** "The Lord will order our steps." God shows us what to do. I make my plan, but God will order my steps. God will show me what to do. So there is human responsibility as well as divine action. This is the Biblicist view.

How does God show us what to do? Sometimes He directs us by opening doors we never saw. You may make a plan saying "in ten years I want to achieve this" - and God will show you a way and in two years it's done. Make the plan, trust God to show you the way.

Sometimes He shows us what to do by directing our steps into new relationships - bringing us into contact with new people, or taking us away from some people. Sometimes it's necessary for your steps to be ordered away from some people. Not that they are bad people. Not that they are witches. Not that they are evil. But it's just that at a certain point in your life, certain relationships may not be what you need for that level of your life. They're not bad people. They're good people. But they have a negative effect on you.

## On Sympathy and Progress

There are people who want to make you feel comfortable with your misery. When you say "oh, life is hard," they'll say "me too, my brother, tell me!" That's a good sympathizer. But at a certain point, you don't need sympathy in life. You don't need sympathizers. You need people who say "hey, let's stop - let's make it!" You need encouragers.

Wait till you prosper and come and tell them and let them sympathize with your prosperity. But with your struggles, when you are going up, believe me - you don't need sympathy.

Can you imagine somebody running a marathon - he's running and then all the people around say "you are tired, oh you are tired, oh you are tired!" At the last minute he will give up. But everybody knows he's tired. They say "move it! move it!" because they want him to finish.

Sometimes sympathy can be your greatest enemy in life. Sometimes all you need is somebody who doesn't feel your pain and tells you "hey, get over it, get up and move on." You may feel it's cruel, but that's how champions are made. Champions are made by coaches who have no sympathy for your tiredness and frustration but still push you because there is a target to achieve.

---

## On Divine Favor

We make our plans, but God shows us what to do. Sometimes He rearranges the people around us. Sometimes He leads you into paths you had never envisaged. We call it favor. But don't sit and say "I'm waiting for favor, I'm waiting for favor." Divine favor - you don't command favor. Favor happens when you are not looking. Then all of a sudden, God favors you. But you don't plan with favor. Favor is a bonus.

---

## The Biblicist Summary

The Biblicist view says: God has a plan for me, but I'm not just going to sit and say "whatever will be will be." God has a plan for me, but I'm going to plan to meet God's plan. And even if I'm wrong with my planning, I trust the Lord to refine my process and help me to have the right motives.

But I'm not going to say "because I don't have a perfect plan, I'm not going to plan" - because if you do that, your life stays where it is and there's no movement. In the next 10 years, you're going to take some very big steps of your life. And I pray that you do it with the right frame of mind.

## Closing Prayer

Father, we thank you that you know the end from the beginning. You are the Alpha and the Omega. You know our days. You command our days. You know our story, and you know where you are taking us.

We consciously bring ourselves into alignment with your will. We make ourselves available to think your thoughts, to plan with your mind. And help us, Lord, that as we build a life plan, we'll do it with the right mindset - so that the future of our lives will be greater than our past.

In Jesus' name, Amen.

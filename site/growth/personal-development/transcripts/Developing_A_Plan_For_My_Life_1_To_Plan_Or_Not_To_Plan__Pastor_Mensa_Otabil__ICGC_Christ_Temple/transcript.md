## Transcript

Well if you remember at the beginning of the year I indicated that this year 2024 is the 10th year of the 20-year plan. In 2014 I led the church and those of you who are there the time 10 years ago to develop a life plan a 20-year plan and most of you did as some of you probably forgot about your plan but somehow followed it a few people have come to me and said pastor this is my plan and I have seen everything I wrote about 10 years ago come to pass so I decided that since we are in the mid-year of that 20-year plan I will go back to that and I will teach and then we would do a 10-year plan for each one of us each one of us is going to think about who we want to be what we want to do in the next 10 years of our life so I'm going to do a four-part teaching on that subject and at the end of it I will give you a document for each one of you to work your way and develop a life plan which you're going to follow for the next 10 years of your life just add 10 years to your life and you would know where you'll be 10 years from now 10 years from now I'll be about 75 years old and I'll be a very young man at that time I still very active in the Lord so I need to think about what kind of 75 year old I want to be some of you be 45 some of you be 56 some of you will probably be 87 what kind of a person do you want to be 10 years from now and what I'm going to teach is to help each one of us as we build our life plan so my series is titled Developing a plan for my life this is part one developing a plan for my life and my subtitle is to plan or not to plan because many times that is the question we ask ourselves is it biblical for a Christian to plan for their lives is it biblical for a business to plan is should we do that does it fit into what the Bible teaches and and if we don't answer this question whether we we the Bible encourages us to plan or not then then the response we give will be based on how we answer this question to plan or not to plan should we just let life move on should we just live our lives and trust God that everything will be all right so that's what I'm going to answer today or what I'm going to address today now to address that I will start by talking about how people see life the way people see life is is what we will call our philosophy of life our philosophy of life how how we see life and and how we live life now whether you think you have a philosophy of life or not you do each one of us have a way in which we approach life a way in which we live our lives and I'm going to start talking about three fundamental ways that most people see their lives and then from there I will go into the Bible and teach from Jesus Christ and what he says and then we will go into the prophets and end it for today how people see life there are three ways that people and it's not all there there are many of them but I've summarized them into three critical ways that most people see their lives the first view of life people have is the fatalist view the fatalist view and there are those people who would say whatever will be will be whatever will be will be in other words my life has already been determined by some power whether it's fate or destiny or God in a can we call it in Krabbia that you you you have already been decided for who you're going to be so nothing really matters whatever will be will be you don't do anything about it is going to happen anyway and there are many kinds of people who are fatalists most are religious people including Christians and the fatalist view of life is largely a passive approach to life in other words you you are not really doing anything about your life you are just living it out and hoping that it ends somehow and people who have this view approach life from that point of view and and and so they abandon their lives because they believe whatever will be will be the gods have determined it and some Christians who say God you know whatever God wants to do you would do and and so on and so forth and my view is that a lot of Africans a lot of Africans not all but a lot of Africans live life from a fatalistic point of view we believe that whatever will be will be that is one of the main reasons why we are not able to improve our lives that's one reason reasons why we're not able to change our countries and our and our lifestyles because when you have this mindset you believe that whatever will be will be you know just leave it you know just the gods have decided it or God has decided it or fate has decided it or destiny has decided it it's fixed and I can do nothing about it that's the fatalist view and I hope none of you have that but if you have it we will address it the second view that some people have is what I call the humanist view the humanist is opposite of the fatalist the humanist view says I can be whatever I want to be I can be whatever I want to be this is the person who says I am the master of my destiny the captain of my ship as is clearly articulated in the words of the Invictus poem such a person does not have a place for any external force whether it's spiritual or any other view they believe that they own their lives and they they run their lives as they want is the way of most atheists and agnostics people who don't believe in any kind of supernatural world and we see this view growing more and more in the modern world and we read a lot about it in our self-help books that tell us about how to make our lives better from podcasts that people listen to self-help and and things like that it is a predominant view you are we are finding in the Western world where people have through God away but this humanist view is not a new thing it's not a modern thing it is a view that started from the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve that's why they decided we can be God ourselves and that's why they disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden that's what happened at the Tower of Babel when the people said we can be we can determine our destiny we can build as far as we want to go and go through them into confusion so the the humanist view seems appealing because it's empowering and it tells people you can do all that you want to do but we see more and more in the Bible that God opposes that view of life where we think we are the masters of our lives so we have the fatal is view we have the humanist view and the third one is what I call the Biblical view the Biblical view that that basically is the Bible's view and it simply says I choose what God wants for my life I choose what God wants for my life God wants something for me but I also have to choose it so the Biblical's view says God has a plan for me but I'm not passive in that plan I must be active I must do something about it I choose what God wants for my life the Biblical's view is a view of the Pearson who sees the Bible as God's revelation to him or her and as a result this person makes choices based on their understanding of the values of the Bible this is the ideal Christian position although many Christians do not hold a Biblical's view a lot of Christians have a fatal is view or a humanist view very few Christians are intentionally living their lives according to the Bible so these are the three views the fatalist the humanist the Biblical's personal responsibility as well as divine purpose that is the Biblical's the question you aren't want to ask yourself is where do I fit in where where is my mind in this how do I live my life I'm I living from a fatal is view I'm I just a humanist trying to improve my life and I don't care about God or I have a Biblical's view where I choose what I want to do but I also believe God has a purpose for my life and and we're going to try to work our way from this mindset my intention is that we will all end up with a Biblical's view that will not be fatalist and will not be humanist will be Biblical's and I hope that by the time I finish the part four of this teaching when you are now developing your life plan you would do it from the point of view of a Biblical's mind set amen all right so now let's get into the Bible let's start with Jesus Christ what did Jesus say about our plans did Jesus say anything about plans because ultimately as Christians everything we believe is based on Christ Jesus if he opposes something we cannot do it but if he recommends something or he commands something we must do it so what is Jesus's view about planning I'm going to show you two verses in the Bible that gives us Jesus's view the first one is in Matthew chapter 6 verse 31 to 34 Matthew chapter 6 verse 31 to 34 and it says therefore do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for after all these things the Gentiles seek for your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things but seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added to you verse 34 therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about its own things sufficient for the day it's its own problem that's the words of Jesus Christ particularly when you look at verse 34 you could get the impression that Jesus does not want us to plan ahead of time you could get that impression but as with everything that we read in the Bible we have to do a content and context study of what Jesus says because if you only say here's something somebody says at one point and you don't get the other things he says at the point you may end up with a wrong view of what the person is saying so this is one view Jesus is expressing he's saying don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow would take care of itself it seems to be like a fatal is view whatever would be would be they'll just take care of today don't don't worry be happy but we'll look at another statement of Jesus Christ and it's in Luke's gospel chapter 14 verses 28 to 31 and this is what Jesus says for which of you in turning to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost whether he has enough to finish it last after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish all who see it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king that's not sit down first and consider whether he's able with 10,000 to meet him who comes against him with 20,000 so if you read this it will seem like Jesus is telling us that we must plan ahead for the things we want to do so in Matthew he's saying don't worry about tomorrow in look he's saying plan for tomorrow so where do we balance this what where does the Christian place himself in these two extremes of don't worry about tomorrow plan for tomorrow both coming from Jesus Christ so I've tried to summarize what Jesus is teaching with three statements the first one that we learn from these two passages is don't be preoccupied with the things you need don't be preoccupied don't let your life be occupied by the things you need I need clothes I need money I need a wife I need a husband I need children and I need to make it I need to prosper don't be preoccupied that in other words don't let your life consist of your needs and your ambitions don't live a life that is always thinking about oh how do I get it and how do I get it what what what we normally call the hustle the hustle don't just be a hustler who's just going around thinking about how do I get it and how do I get it and how do I make it and how do I prosper and how do I how do I how do I how do I how do I Jesus says don't be preoccupied with the things you need that's that that's a very important teaching so when we're talking about planning having a ten-year plan don't have a ten-year plan in mind because oh you want to rush to make it very quickly Jesus says don't be preoccupied the second thing Jesus is saying is that make God's will your priority and choice seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness so don't let things be a priority let God be a priority so there is a sequence there don't be preoccupied with the things you need be occupied with God and his kingdom and his righteousness his morality what God says is right so that's the second thing that we learn from Jesus and the third thing that Jesus is saying is plan adequately for the things you want if you want a building don't sit down and hope that the building will build itself if you want to have something don't just say oh whatever will be will be he says plan for it plan for it plan for what you want to have done in the future in the particular instance Jesus is talking about planning to build and life is like a building what are you building with your life what are my building what do I want to achieve yes I don't have to be preoccupied yes I have to occupy myself with God but I have to plan I have to think about what I need I have to think about everything that is required for this building to be built up and anybody who has built a building understands you plan from land digging iron rods cement sand stones maces foreman electricians who don't keep appointments you have to plan all of these things you have to plan the kind of building you're going to build there's going to be three bedroom four bedroom five bedroom how am I going to finish it I'm not going to tile it I'm not going to paint it all of that and each one there are about a thousand different decisions you have to make another to build and Jesus says if you're going to build you have to plan for each one of them now if you plan to build a house a building don't you think your life is more important than a building that you cannot leave your life to chance the next 10 years is coming whether you plan for it or not whether I plan for it or not 10 years from now be 75 I can slip my way to 75 and I'll still be 75 I can decide okay I'll do nothing I'll still be 75 but I can also decide this is what I want to achieve by 75 and work towards something that I want to build in my life by 75 and when I'm 75 I can look back and say did I build it whether you plan on what you will grow that's how grow you will grow but what kind of grown do you want to be all right so we see Jesus's view that we don't get preoccupied with the things we need we make gods with our priority and choice and we plan adequately for the things we want so let's take it from there the big question most Christians wrestle with is if I'm going to plan how am I going to be sure that this plan is God's way or not God's way I want to plan something how do I how am I sure that this is the right plan to make for my life that's always a difficult thing and there are no easy answers to that and I cannot tell you specifically that this plan is God's way or that plan is God's way but I can give you guidelines from the Bible and I'm going to give you two statements from the book of Proverbs both come from chapter 16 of the book of Proverbs and we're going to look at those statements and I'm going to explain them to see how we work our way between God's way and our way God's plan and my plan how do I make my way here especially if you you are familiar with the Bible and most of us are very familiar with passages that says there are many plans in a man's heart never the law never the laws counsel that will stand so sometimes you get impression you know even if I make a plan God will just you know blow it away God because you know many other plans in a man's heart but there's a lot's purpose that will prevail and so many times we say okay I'm not even going to make a plan because God will end up prevailing is that the way we should take to say I'm not going to do anything but I hope that God's plan will prevail that's a fatalist view that's a view that says I do nothing whatever will be will be that's not a Christian view that's not a Biblical's view so let's look at these two passages and as we try to answer that question the first one is in Proverbs chapter 16 verses two and three Proverbs chapter 16 verses two and three it says all the ways of a man appear in his own eyes but the Lord weighs the spirits commit your west to the Lord and your thoughts will be established so this passage is saying two important things first it says we determine what we want we determine what we want all the ways of a man appear in his own eyes we determine what we want that simply means we live life as we see it so when we are making plans for our lives we are making plans as we see it as we see life as we see our future if you are born into deep poverty you may develop a deep desire in your heart to break out of poverty and be rich therefore if that is how if you are born into deep poverty like most of us were I was born into poverty like most Ghanians are I mean most of us were born into poverty some deeper than others some go very very deep some are surface poverty but all of us were born into poverty only a few of you sitting here would say I was not born into poverty only a few who would say my father or my parents had something and and when we were born you know those something the house and most people my generation were born to poverty my father never had a car never only house we didn't have a TV set we didn't have a fridge you know until later I remember the first time we had a fridge in our home it was like heaven came down and glory filled I mean we'll go and open the fridge it was an indecent fridge we open it and it was a big production and my father was so proud he has bought a fridge so most of us were born into poverty in fact even the poverty I was born into was sefis somewhere born into deeper now because most of us are born into poverty one of the big drives of our lives is we want to prosper and because that is the deep thing in our lives and as Matthew says we get preoccupied what we eat what we drink what we wear it's it's the most important thing in our minds it's so strong that sometimes you don't care how you prosper so it says a man's ways appear in his own eyes I have seen people who steal from other people and justify it with their hardship or maybe you want a husband so much and you feel I need to marry before I die that you don't care whether you're taking somebody's husband or not because you're driven by your need and it's pure in your side you can justify it you can tell everybody the reason why you must get that one and get that one and make that money because you have suffered so what that's what probably says is a man's ways what he determines he wants can be pure in his own sight so in making a plan there are things that you think are so justified because of where you are coming from life as beating you I need to make it but that's not the only thing look at the next statement the prophet says he says but the Lord weighs the Spirit in other words God examines and corrects our motives so we are having a plan we want a prosper but maybe because of our poverty we want a prosper at every cost as Malcolm X said by any means necessary we want to do it by any means necessary but are we going to fulfill our plans by any means necessary no the Bible says God examines and corrects our motives so sometimes you make a plan about what you want to be in the next 10 years and you put the things down but God finds a way to correct your motives so that yes the plan is clear the vision is clear but the means for getting it is now purified by God and he gives you righteous means by which you can get the things you want if you don't get it that way your determination can be pure in your eyes but will be totally wrong all the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes but the Lord weighs the Spirit he commands he corrects our motives the second scripture is from the same chapter or promise the promise chapter 16 and this is verse 9 and man's heart plans his way but the Lord directs his steps so there is what man is doing and what God is doing so what does it say says we make our plans and man's heart plans his way we should not be afraid to initiate plans for our lives we cannot be passive about our lives we must be intentional about what we want for our lives even if you are not fully sure you must have a plan if you're not fully sure still have a plan don't go through life and say I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know what to do yes all of us at a certain level don't know what to do I am not 100% sure about my life you are not 100% sure about our life about your life so the fact that you're not 100% sure does not mean don't plan so we must make plans for our lives we plan our ways we set in the plans and look at what God does he says the Lord will order our steps in other words God shows us what to do so I make my plan but God will order my steps God will show me what to do so there is a human responsibility as well as divine action this is the Biblical's view and how does God show us what to do sometimes he directs us by opening doors we never saw so you know you you may make a plan say in in ten years I want to achieve this and God will show you a way and in two years it's done so make the plan trust God to show you the way make the plan trust God to orchestrate events in your life God shows us what to do and he sometimes he shows us what to do by directing our steps into new relationships bringing us into contact with new people all taking us away from some people sometimes it's necessary for your steps to be ordered away from some people not that they are bad people not that they are witches not that they are evil but it's just that at a certain point in your life certain relationships may not be what you need for that level of your life they're not bad people they're good people but they're a negative effect on you there are people who want to make you feel comfortable with your misery and when you say oh life is how they'll say me my brother tell me oh hey it's hard papa you think you also it's hard let me tell you mine now that's a good sympathizer but at a certain point you don't need sympathy in life you don't need sympathizers you need people who say hey let's stop let's make it you need encourages so wait till your prosper and come and tell him and let him sympathize with your prosperity but with your struggles when you are going up believe me you don't need sympathy life is so hard you don't need people to sympathize you don't need people to pity you I don't like pity I don't even like sympathy as a person I don't if I'm carrying a burden I need to carry it because life is not easy life is hard you don't expect when you're carrying everybody's a ubra ubra ubra ubra a top way a top way because when you are tired you don't want people to tell you you are tired can you imagine somebody running a marathon he's running he's running and then all the people are around say hey you are tired oh you are tired oh you are tired oh at the last minute he will give up but everybody knows he's tired they say move it move it move it because they want him to finish sometimes sympathy can be your greatest enemy in life sometimes all you need is somebody who doesn't feel your pain and tells you hey get over it get up and move on and you may feel cruel but that's how champions are made champions are made by coaches who have no sympathy for your tiredness and frustration but still push you because there is a target to achieve so we make our plans but God shows us what to do sometimes he rearranges the people around us sometimes he leads you into parts you had never envisaged we call it favor but don't sit and say I'm waiting for favor I'm waiting for favor I'm waiting for favor divine favor divine favor you don't command favor favor happens when you are not looking then all of a sudden God favors you but you don't plan with favor favor is a bonus right so the Bibles' view says God has a plan for me but I'm not just going to sit and say whatever will be will be God has a plan for me but I'm going to plan to meet God's plan and even if I'm wrong with my planning I trust the Lord to refine my process and help me to have the right motives but I'm not going to say because I don't have a perfect plan I'm not going to plan because if you do that your life stays where it is and there's no movement in the next 10 years you're going to take some very big steps of your life and I pray that you do it with the right frame of mind and the mind well let's pray father we thank you that you know the end from the beginning you are the Alpha and the Omega you know our days you command our days you know our story and you know where you are taking us we consciously bring ourselves into alignment with your will we make ourselves available to think your thoughts to plan with your mind and help us a Lord that as we build a life plan we'll do with the right mindset so that the future of our lives will be greater than our past in Jesus name amen

## SLIDE 1: TITLE
### Developing A Plan For My Life
**Part 2: From Here To There**

Pastor Mensa Otabil
ICGC Christ Temple

*A 10-Year Life Planning Framework (2024-2034)*

---

## SLIDE 2: THE JOURNEY
### FROM HERE TO THERE

**HERE** = Where you are now (your present reality)

**THERE** = Where God wants you to be (your destination)

**THE GAP** = 10 years of intentional movement

> "That's what a life plan is all about. It's moving you from where you are to where you ought to be."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE UPWARD CALL
### Not Just Forward... But UPWARD

> "Paul doesn't call it a forward call, but he calls it upward. There's a big difference between forward and upward."

**FORWARD** = Same level, easier path
**UPWARD** = Against gravity, requires extra effort

Like exercising on an **inclined treadmill** vs. flat ground

Your 10-year plan is an **anti-gravity movement**

---

## SLIDE 4: TWO CORE MINDSETS
### The Foundation of Life Planning

**MINDSET 1:**
"God has a place He wants me to be"
*There is a divine destination for my life*

**MINDSET 2:**
"I must do everything I can to get there"
*Divine purpose requires human effort*

> "Everybody who is mature must have the same mindset."
> — Philippians 3:12-14

---

## SLIDE 5: UNDERSTANDING HERE
### Your Present Reality

**What is HERE?**
- Where I am right now
- My spiritual life
- My physical health
- My relationships
- My career
- My finances

**Critical Question:**
"What got me HERE?"

---

## SLIDE 6: WHAT GOT ME HERE?
### Two Forces Shaping Your Life

**EXTERNAL FORCES** (Done for/to me)
- Country of birth
- Family background
- Economic conditions
- Cultural factors
- Technological changes
- Global circumstances

**INTERNAL CHOICES** (What I did)
- Education decisions
- Relationship choices
- Habits formed
- Values adopted
- Risks taken/avoided

> "Your life is not an accident... There's always a logic behind everybody's life."

---

## SLIDE 7: LIFE HAS LOGIC
### Nothing is Random

> "Everybody's life makes sense. If you take time to analyze, you can simply and easily see all the things that have brought you to where you are. It's not magic, it's not a mystery, it's all logical."

**YOUR TASK:**
Take a snapshot of your life today
Answer: "What brought me HERE?"

---

## SLIDE 8: DEFINING THERE
### Your God-Ordained Destination

**THERE is not just a place...**

It can be:
- A spiritual maturity level
- A mental/emotional state
- A relational position
- A professional achievement
- A character transformation
- A ministry calling

> "Sometimes there is not a physical place. It's a spiritual place. Sometimes there is a mental place. Sometimes there is a social place."

---

## SLIDE 9: YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
### Time Demands Movement

> "You cannot stay here forever. And the reason why nobody can stay at one place forever is because time is moving. And when time moves, a place that is good for you can be corrupted in the next year."

**THE TRUTH:**
- Time doesn't stand still
- Good situations decay without maintenance
- Change is inevitable
- Planning protects you from being shocked

---

## SLIDE 10: THE POWER OF 10 YEARS
### 2024 to 2034

> "A lot can happen in 10 years. Don't take for granted what God can accomplish with your life and through your life in the next 10 years."

**EXAMPLES FROM LAST 10 YEARS:**
- Smartphones revolutionized communication
- Remote work became normal
- AI entered everyday life
- WhatsApp video calls to anyone, anywhere
- Digital skills became essential

**QUESTION:** What will YOUR next 10 years bring?

---

## SLIDE 11: BIBLICAL FOUNDATION
### Philippians 3:12-14

**Paul's Declaration:**

> "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but **I press on** that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me."

> "**Forgetting those things which are behind** and **reaching forward** to those things which are ahead, I **press toward the goal** for the prize of the **upward call** of God in Christ Jesus."

**THREE ACTIONS:**
1. Press on (keep moving)
2. Forget the past
3. Reach forward

---

## SLIDE 12: FOUR STEPS TO GET THERE
### From 1 Kings 17:3-4 (Elijah at Brook Cherith)

God's Commands to Elijah:

1. **GET AWAY** - Make a move
2. **TURN** - Change direction
3. **HIDE** - Set yourself apart
4. **DRINK** - Receive fresh input

> "If you do these four things, then you will get there."

---

## SLIDE 13: STEP 1 - GET AWAY
### Make A Move

> "You can't move from here to there by staying here. You have to get away. You have to take a step."

**THE PRINCIPLE:**
One small step → Giant leap

> "One small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind."
> — Neil Armstrong

**ACTION STEPS:**
- Talk to that person
- Register for that course
- Apply for that opportunity
- Seek that advice
- Take that test

**Small steps lead to big outcomes**

---

## SLIDE 14: STEP 2 - TURN
### Change Direction

> "You always end up in a place where you are headed."

**THE TRUTH ABOUT "GENERATIONAL CURSES":**

> "What people usually call generational curses are simply people repeating the same choices and patterns that they've seen in their parents or their elders. It's just repetition."

**THE SOLUTION:**
- Eat different food → Different health outcomes
- Make different marriage choices → Different relationships
- Choose different financial habits → Different prosperity
- Live your life differently from the example you saw

---

## SLIDE 15: BREAK THE PATTERN
### Live Differently

> "You have to live your life differently from the example you saw. From your father's example, your mother's example, your elder's example, Ghanaian example."

**KEY INSIGHT:**
It's not spiritual forces
It's repeated choices
You have power to TURN

**TURN means:**
- Paddle your canoe in the opposite direction
- Choose different models
- Break family dysfunction
- Establish new patterns

---

## SLIDE 16: STEP 3 - HIDE
### Set Yourself Apart

> "Many of the important things we have to do must be done alone. And away from the public. Most of the things done in public are for show."

**THE PRINCIPLE:**
Real transformation happens in private

> "The things that really change our lives are done privately."

> "The things that make people happy, they don't change you."

**HIDE MEANS:**
- Work on character when no one is watching
- Pray intimately with God
- Do important work away from social media
- Seek God's approval over people's applause

---

## SLIDE 17: PROGRESS ISN'T POPULAR
### Expect Opposition

> "Popularity will not get you anywhere. Progress is not a popular thing. And if you want everybody to side with you, you're going to be very sad in life."

**PASTOR'S TESTIMONY:**
When called to ministry, his best friend said:
**"You are a fool"**
(Said with good intention and compassion)

**THE LESSON:**
If you wait for everyone's approval, you'll never act

---

## SLIDE 18: STEP 4 - DRINK
### Receive Fresh Input

> "You're going to get something fresh in your life. You're going to receive fresh books, fresh water."

> "You're going to learn things that are different from what you have known. You're going to expose yourself to new knowledge, new information, new relationships, new concepts."

**FRESH INPUT INCLUDES:**
- New books and learning
- Different perspectives
- Digital/tech skills
- Diverse relationships
- Challenging ideas

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
The world is changing. Stay current or get left behind.

---

## SLIDE 19: THE AI REALITY
### External Forces You Can't Control

> "There's artificial intelligence. I may not like it, but I can't control it. Very soon, a lot of people's jobs will be taken over by programs."

**THE CHALLENGE:**
- Analog education in a digital world
- "Educated illiterates" (trained in old methods)
- Skills becoming obsolete
- Technology disrupting careers

**THE RESPONSE:**
**DRINK** - Learn continuously, especially technology

---

## SLIDE 20: ALMOST EVERYTHING CAN BE OVERCOME
### The Power of Human Innovation

> "Almost every situation can be overcome in life. Almost every situation can be overcome."

**EXAMPLES:**
- Humans learned to fly (once impossible)
- From no phones → to video calls across continents
- From trunk calls → to WhatsApp
- From office jobs → to remote work worldwide

**THE POINT:**
What seems impossible today becomes normal tomorrow through intentional effort

---

## SLIDE 21: PLAN OR BE SHOCKED
### The Choice Is Yours

> "I don't want the next 10 years to shock any one of us. I don't want life to shock us."

> "Please, be a fool now. Not there. Take all the right steps now."

**THE CONTRAST:**
**WITHOUT PLANNING:**
10 years later: "I've been a fool"

**WITH PLANNING:**
10 years later: "Wow, look at what I have achieved. Look at the things I've done. I'm a better person."

---

## SLIDE 22: PURPOSE MATTERS
### Living Significantly

> "It's very important to me that each one of us live a purposeful, significant life to the glory of God."

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL**
Not just for pastors
Not just for "called" people
For EVERYONE who follows Christ

**THE GOAL:**
- Purposeful living
- Significant impact
- Glory to God
- 10 years of intentional growth

---

## SLIDE 25: THE CLOSING PRAYER

> "And we come and commit ourselves in surrender to that upward call. And we say, Lord, I will not stay where we are, but we're going to get to where you want us to be."

> "Help us, Lord, to understand all the factors that brought us where we are. And beyond that, help us to take all the right steps to get to where you want us to be in Jesus' name we pray. Amen."

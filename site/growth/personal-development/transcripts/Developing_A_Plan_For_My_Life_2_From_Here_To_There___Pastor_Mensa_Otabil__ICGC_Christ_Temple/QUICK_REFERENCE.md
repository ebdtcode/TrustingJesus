## THE CORE MESSAGE
**Journey**: From HERE (where you are now) to THERE (where God wants you in 10 years)
**Timeline**: 2024 to 2034
**Nature**: UPWARD movement (against gravity, requires extra effort)

---

## TWO FOUNDATIONAL MINDSETS

1. **God has a place He wants me to be** (Divine Purpose)
2. **I must do everything I can to get there** (Human Responsibility)

## FOUR ACTION STEPS (From 1 Kings 17:3-4)

### 1. GET AWAY - Make a Move
- Take action, even a small step
- "One small step can lead to a giant leap"
- Examples: Register for course, have that conversation, apply for opportunity

### 2. TURN - Change Direction
- Break generational patterns
- Make different choices than parents/peers
- Stop repeating what brought you HERE if you want to get THERE

### 3. HIDE - Set Yourself Apart
- Do important work privately
- Avoid performing for public approval
- Real transformation happens in secret
- "The things that make people happy don't change you"

### 4. DRINK - Receive Fresh Input
- Learn new things
- Read new books
- Build new relationships
- Expose yourself to different concepts
- Stay current with technology

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS

**On Time**: "You cannot stay here forever... time is moving"

**On Life Logic**: "Your life is not an accident... there's always a logic behind everybody's life"

**On Generational Curses**: "Simply people repeating the same choices and patterns... It's just repetition"

**On Possibility**: "Almost every situation can be overcome in life"

**On Progress**: "Progress is not a popular thing"

**On 10 Years**: "A lot can happen in 10 years... don't take for granted what God can accomplish"

## OBSTACLES TO ANTICIPATE

1. **Technological Disruption** - AI, digital transformation, obsolete skills
2. **Social Pressure** - Others calling you foolish, pressure to conform
3. **Time Decay** - What's good today won't stay good without effort
4. **Generational Patterns** - Unconscious repetition of family dysfunction

## Executive Summary

This powerful sermon by Pastor Mensa Otabil focuses on the critical importance of intentional life planning. As part 2 of a series on developing a life plan, this message specifically addresses the journey "from here to there" - moving from your current position to your God-ordained destination over the next 10 years (2024-2034).

The teaching marks the midpoint of a 20-year life plan initiative Pastor Otabil launched in 2014, making this a strategic checkpoint for renewal and recommitment to purposeful living. The message emphasizes that significant transformation requires anti-gravity effort, conscious decision-making, and divine partnership.

## Core Theme: FROM HERE TO THERE

The central metaphor of the message is the journey "from here to there" - a movement that requires:
1. Understanding where you currently are (HERE)
2. Identifying where God wants you to be (THERE)
3. Taking deliberate steps to bridge the gap
4. Pressing upward against the forces of gravity

---

## Key Biblical Foundations

### Primary Text: Philippians 3:12-14
**Paul's Mindset for Progress:**
- "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on"
- "Forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead"
- "I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus"

**Two Core Principles:**
1. **God has a place He wants me to be** - There is a divine destination for every life
2. **I must do everything I can to get there** - Personal responsibility and effort are essential

### Supporting Text: 1 Kings 17:1-4 (Elijah at Brook Cherith)
**Four Action Steps God Commanded:**
1. **Get away** - Make a move, take action
2. **Turn** - Change direction, break patterns
3. **Hide** - Set yourself apart for private transformation
4. **Drink** - Receive fresh input, new knowledge, different perspectives

---

## Major Themes and Insights

### 1. THE UPWARD CALL (Not Just Forward)

**Key Quote**: *"Paul doesn't call it a forward call, but he calls it upward. There's a big difference between forward and upward. Both are in the future. But when something is simply forward, it simply means you are moving on the same level... But when something is upward, it means not only are you moving forward but you are moving against gravity."*

**Insight**: Meaningful progress requires anti-gravity effort. Like exercising on an inclined treadmill versus flat ground, moving upward demands greater intensity, commitment, and energy.

**Application**: Your 10-year plan should challenge you beyond comfort zones. If it's easy, it's not taking you upward.

---

### 2. UNDERSTANDING "HERE" - Your Present Reality

**Definition**: HERE is where you are right now - spiritually, physically, socially, professionally, financially, relationally.

**Critical Questions to Ask:**
- What got me HERE?
- What are the EXTERNAL forces that brought me to this place? (country of birth, family background, economic conditions, cultural factors, technological changes)
- What are the INTERNAL choices I made that brought me HERE? (decisions, habits, relationships, education, values)

**Key Quote**: *"Your life is not an accident, and nobody's life is an accident. There's always a logic behind everybody's life... It's not magic, it's not a mystery, it's all logical. It makes sense."*

**Insight**: Every life has a traceable pattern. Understanding your current position requires honest analysis of both external circumstances and personal choices.

**Application**: Take a snapshot of your life today. Document where you are in every major area before planning where you're going.

---

### 3. DEFINING "THERE" - Your God-Ordained Destination

**Definition**: THERE is your future - where God wants you to be in 10 years.

**Key Quote**: *"There is my future. It's where I'm going. So to Elijah, when God says you're going to move from here to there, there is physical. But sometimes there is not a physical place. It's a spiritual place. Sometimes there is a mental place. Sometimes there is a social place."*

**Important Note**: "THERE" may not be a geographic location but could be:
- A spiritual maturity level
- A mental/emotional state
- A relational position
- A professional achievement
- A character transformation
- A ministry calling

**Application**: Define your "THERE" in multiple dimensions - spiritual, physical, relational, professional, financial, emotional.

---

### 4. THE JOURNEY - How to Get from HERE to THERE

#### External Forces Working Against You
- Economic conditions
- Technological disruption
- Cultural pressures
- Generational patterns
- Age-related changes
- Global circumstances

**Key Quote**: *"There's artificial intelligence. I may not like it, but I can't control it. Very soon, a lot of people's jobs will be taken over by programs."*

#### Internal Actions You Must Take

**The Four Commands from Elijah's Story:**

**A. GET AWAY - Make a Move**
- Take action, even if it's a small step
- Don't wait for perfect conditions
- Movement creates momentum

**Key Quote**: *"You can't move from here to there by staying here. You have to get away. You have to take a step... One small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind."*

**Actionable Steps**:
- Register for that course
- Have that difficult conversation
- Apply for that opportunity
- Seek advice from a mentor
- Take a health screening
- Open that business account

**B. TURN - Change Direction**
- Break generational patterns
- Make different choices than your parents/peers
- Shift your trajectory

**Key Quote**: *"What people usually call generational curses are simply people repeating the same choices and patterns that they've seen in their parents or their elders. It's just repetition."*

**Actionable Steps**:
- Identify family patterns you need to break
- Choose different relationship models
- Adopt new financial habits
- Change your diet and lifestyle choices
- Reject limiting cultural beliefs

**C. HIDE - Set Yourself Apart**
- Do important work privately
- Avoid performing for public approval
- Create space for genuine transformation

**Key Quote**: *"Many of the important things we have to do must be done alone. And away from the public. Most of the things done in public are for show... The things that really change our lives are done privately."*

**Actionable Steps**:
- Establish private prayer time
- Create a personal development routine
- Limit social media performance
- Work on character when no one is watching
- Seek God's approval over people's applause

**D. DRINK - Receive Fresh Input**
- Learn new things
- Expose yourself to new knowledge
- Build new relationships
- Engage with different concepts

**Key Quote**: *"You're going to receive fresh books, fresh water. You're going to learn things that are different from what you have known. You're going to expose yourself to new knowledge, new information, new relationships, new concepts."*

**Actionable Steps**:
- Read books outside your comfort zone
- Attend workshops and seminars
- Learn new skills (especially digital/technological)
- Connect with diverse people
- Consume content that challenges you

### 5. THE POWER OF A 10-YEAR PLAN

**Timeline**: 2024 to 2034

**Key Quote**: *"A lot can happen in 10 years. A lot can happen if you look globally at all the things that have happened in the last 10 years, the technology, political changes and all of that, so much can happen in a 10-year life span. So don't take for granted what God can accomplish with your life and through your life in the next 10 years."*

**Why 10 Years Matters**:
- Long enough for significant transformation
- Short enough to maintain focus
- Aligns with generational shifts
- Spans major technological changes
- Provides strategic checkpoint for 20-year vision

---

### 6. OVERCOMING OBSTACLES

**Key Quote**: *"Almost every situation can be overcome in life. Almost every situation can be overcome."*

**Examples Cited**:
- Human flight (once impossible, now routine)
- Global communication (from trunk calls to WhatsApp video calls)
- Remote work (earning international income from home)
- Technological revolution (analog to digital transformation)

**Insight**: What seems impossible today becomes ordinary tomorrow through intentional effort and adaptation.

---

### 7. THE DANGER OF STAYING WHERE YOU ARE

**Key Quote**: *"You cannot stay here forever. And the reason why nobody can stay at one place forever is because time is moving. And when time moves, a place that is good for you can be corrupted in the next year."*

**Critical Point**: Even if your current position is comfortable, change is inevitable. Planning protects you from being shocked by change.

**Application**: Plan now so 10 years from now you can say "Look at what I achieved" rather than "I've been a fool."

## Power Quotes for Personal Development

1. **On Purpose**: *"It's very important to me that each one of us live a purposeful, significant life to the glory of God."*

2. **On Mindset**: *"If we're going to have a plan for our lives, that is the first mind we must have. That we're not just trying to figure out something for ourselves. But God already has something he wants to do with our lives."*

3. **On Difficulty**: *"If I'm going to have a meaningful 10 year plan, it's not going to be a 10 year plan based on doing what is easy, but it's going to be a 10 year plan doing something that is against the force of gravity."*

4. **On Life Logic**: *"Everybody's life makes sense. If you take time to analyze, you can simply and easily see all the things that have brought you to where you are. It's not magic, it's not a mystery, it's all logical."*

5. **On Taking Action**: *"Sometimes you can take a small step. But that small step can lead to a giant leap."*

6. **On Breaking Patterns**: *"You have to live your life differently from the example you saw. From your father's example, your mother's example, your elder's example."*

7. **On Private Work**: *"The things that truly impact you, you hide. You are alone. You go into [solitude] and you do them. The things that make people happy, they don't change you."*

8. **On Popular Opinion**: *"Progress is not a popular thing. And if you want everybody to side with you, you're going to be very sad in life."*

9. **On Fresh Learning**: *"You're going to get something fresh in your life. You're going to receive fresh books, fresh water."*

10. **On Vision**: *"No matter what comes against us, we can move from here to there."*

## Biblical Framework for Life Planning

### Core Theology
- God has a plan for every life (Jeremiah 29:11)
- We must partner with God's plan through intentional effort (Philippians 2:12-13)
- The journey requires pressing forward and upward (Philippians 3:13-14)
- Transformation happens through renewing the mind (Romans 12:2)
- We are co-laborers with God (1 Corinthians 3:9)

### Prayer Focus
*"Lord, there is a place you have for us. There is a place prepared. There is a high calling. There is an upward call you have for us. And we come and commit ourselves in surrender to that upward call. And we say, Lord, I will not stay where we are, but we're going to get to where you want us to be. Help us, Lord, to understand all the factors that are brought us where we are. And beyond that, help us to take all the right steps to get to where you want us to be in Jesus' name we pray. Amen."*

This sermon provides a robust biblical and practical framework for intentional life planning. The central message is clear: God has an upward calling for every believer, and reaching that calling requires partnership between divine purpose and human effort.

The journey from HERE to THERE is not automatic or easy—it's an anti-gravity movement that demands conscious decision-making, strategic planning, and persistent action. But with clear vision, practical steps, and faith in God's plan, the next 10 years can be the most transformative decade of your life.

**Final Challenge**: Don't let the next 10 years shock you. Plan now. Act now. Move from HERE to THERE with intentionality and faith.

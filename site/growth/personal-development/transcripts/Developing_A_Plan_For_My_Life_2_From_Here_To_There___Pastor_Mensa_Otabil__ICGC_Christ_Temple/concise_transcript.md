## Introduction

As you know, I am teaching on developing a plan for my life and this is part two. The reason why I'm teaching this is because I believe that each one of us must have a plan for our lives. Ten years ago in 2014, I initiated the 20-year life plan and encouraged most of you who were then there to have a 20-year plan. This is the mid-way of the 20-year life plan - we've done 10 years of it.

So I felt that I should come back, renew my teaching on a life plan, and at the end of my series, help each one of us to put together a plan for the next 10 years of our lives. It's very important to me that each one of us live a purposeful, significant life to the glory of God.

My subtitle for today is "From Here to There." That's what a life plan is all about. It's moving you from where you are to where you ought to be. We are looking at a 10-year life plan - from 2024 to 2034, from here to there.

A lot can happen in 10 years. A lot can happen if you look globally at all the things that have happened in the last 10 years - the technology, political changes and all of that. So much can happen in a 10-year life span. So don't take for granted what God can accomplish with your life and through your life in the next 10 years.

## Paul's Mindset: The Upward Call

### Philippians 3:12-14

I'm going to start with a reading from the book of Philippians chapter 3, verses 12 to 14. In this passage, the Apostle Paul speaks about his mindset:

> "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."

Later on, he says everybody who is mature must have the same mindset.

### Two Core Principles

I would try to summarize what Paul is saying here with two sentences:

**1. God has a place He wants me to be.** God has a plan for my life. There is a place that God wants me to get to. That's the first mindset we have to have if we're going to have a life plan. We're not just trying to figure out something for ourselves. God already has something He wants to do with our lives.

**2. I must do everything I can to get there.** He talks about pressing on, about forgetting the things that are behind so that I get to the place God wants me to be.

### Upward, Not Just Forward

I was struck by it as I was studying the text - he doesn't even call it a forward call, but he calls it upward. There's a big difference between forward and upward. Both are in the future. But when something is simply forward, it simply means you are moving on the same level - moving from one place to the other. It is difficult but not too difficult.

But when something is upward, it means not only are you moving forward but you are moving against gravity. You're trying to go up, and it is more difficult to go up than to go at the same level.

For those of you who have been exercising on the treadmill - if you're walking on the treadmill and it's the same level, it's easy. But when you go on an incline, that becomes very difficult. Those of you who jog know it's very easy to walk on plain land, but if you go up, then you're doing an upward call. It becomes more intense.

So Paul is saying what God has for me is not just forward - it's upward. I have to push extra hard to get to where God wants me to be. If I'm going to have a meaningful 10-year plan, it's not going to be a 10-year plan based on doing what is easy, but it's going to be a 10-year plan doing something that is against the force of gravity.

One of the reasons why most of us live life, and sometimes we stay where we are and time doesn't change our lives positively, is because we're not ready to put in the hard work that will take us from where we are on an upward call.

## The Prophet Elijah: From Here to There

### 1 Kings 17:1-4

Let's go to the Old Testament, to something that God said to the Prophet Elijah:

> "And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, 'As the Lord God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word.' Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 'Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.'"

I want you to look at the first sentence in verse 3: "Get away from here." And then the last phrase of verse 4: "Feed you there."

So there are two locations that God is talking to Elijah about: HERE and THERE.

At the time God is speaking to Elijah, there is a famine in the land because there is no rain. Elijah says there is not going to be rain. But the fact that he has said there is not going to be rain does not mean he will be exempted. If there is no rain, the economy will be ruined and he will suffer. If he stayed in the place where there is no rain, he is going to be poor. He is going to suffer, he will be hungry, he will starve to death.

So God says to Elijah: I am going to move you from here to there.

When you make a plan for your life, that is what you are doing. You are moving from here to there.

## Understanding "HERE" - Your Present Reality

### What Is "Here"?

"Here" is simply where I am - my present life. It is where you are right now. That is your "here." Everybody has a "here."

Some people's "here" is good. They are in a good place at this time. Some of you can look at the year 2024, look at your life now and say, "It has never been better." That is your "here."

Some people will look at their lives and say, "Wow, it is a mixed bag. It is good and bad." That is your "here."

Some people's "here" is not good. They look at it and say, "Oh God, how did I get here?"

Whether it is good, bad, or ugly - you are here.

### You Cannot Stay Here Forever

But you cannot stay here forever. The reason why nobody can stay at one place forever is because time is moving. And when time moves, a place that is good for you can be corrupted in the next year. Many things will happen, times will change, people will change, factors will change. All of a sudden, you were here, everything was good, time changes, and "here" is no longer great.

That's why whether it is good for you, bad for you, or ugly for you - you cannot stay here. Because time requires that you do not let only things happen to you. You must plan for things before they happen to you. That's why having a plan is so critical. Whether your life is happy or not, you still have to make a plan for the future.

### What Got Me Here?

How do we get out from here? If we are going to get out from here, there is a big question we have to ask ourselves: How did I get here? What brought me here?

Many of us are not happy with our lives, but we are not asking "what brought me here?" Many times we are asking "who brought me here?" But what brought me here? What are the factors? What are the things that got me to where I am?

To answer that question, you have to look at it from an external point of view and an internal point of view.

**External Forces** - Things that have been done for you or to you. You didn't do it - it was done for you or to you. Like the country you are born into. I didn't choose Ghana, did you? You didn't choose your parents. You grow up and find, "Oh wow, that's my father. That's my mother." Sometimes you like them, sometimes you don't. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad, sometimes they are irresponsible.

The drunkard has children. The prostitute has children. All kinds of people have children. And can you imagine what does it mean for their children?

**Internal Factors** - Things you also did. What you did for yourself or did to yourself. Sometimes we reinforce the external or sometimes we go against it. If a boat is on a river and the river is moving one way eastward, the rider of the boat can take a paddle and actually turn the boat to go the opposite direction. That's internal.

Your life is not an accident, and nobody's life is an accident. There's always a logic behind everybody's life. Even when you think "my life doesn't make sense" - it makes sense perfectly. Everybody's life makes sense. If you take time to analyze, you can simply and easily see all the things that have brought you to where you are. It's not magic, it's not a mystery. It's all logical. It makes sense.

## Understanding "THERE" - Your God-Ordained Destination

### What Is "There"?

"There" is my future. It's where I'm going.

When God says to Elijah you're going to move from here to there, "there" is physical. But sometimes "there" is not a physical place. It's a spiritual place. Sometimes "there" is a mental place. Sometimes "there" is a social place. It's not a physical place. So you don't have to physically move to get there. You have to do something in your mind to get there.

### How Do I Get There?

What are the things pushing against me, preventing me from getting there? I want to make it, but something is stopping me from making it. I want to serve God, but something is pushing me from serving God. I want to be more spiritual, but I'm getting more and more carnal. I want to overcome this habit, but it's getting stronger in my life.

**External Forces Against You:**

If you look at technology - if you were trained in analog school and the world becomes digital, you may find that you went to school but you are still an illiterate. There are a lot of educated illiterates because they went to analog school and the world has become digital.

There's artificial intelligence. I may not like it, but I can't control it. Very soon, a lot of people's jobs will be taken over by programs. Things that you want to invest in to study for - somebody will just ask a question on an app and it will give an answer that is ten times better than all that your lecturer has taught you.

That's external. It's coming against your career, your business, everything.

**Internal Actions You Must Take:**

What should I do to overcome these external things that are against me?

One of the good things about life is that almost every situation can be overcome. Almost every situation can be overcome. Look at the kinds of things we have overcome in our world. Human beings being able to fly - if you lived a thousand years ago, nobody would think that was possible.

Look at what has happened in the last twenty years. These days it's very easy to take a phone, have data, use WhatsApp, and in real time have a face-to-face conversation with somebody living thousands of miles away. Somebody is in Japan and you're chatting with them.

When I was growing up, that was not even a thought. Having a telephone to make a call was a big deal. One person in your neighborhood has a telephone and everybody goes to take their call from that one person's house. In my community, nobody had a telephone. We had to go to the post office to make a telephone call. And when you're calling, it's a trunk call - the call has to be "trunked."

But now look at how we have overcome time and distance. People can live in Ghana and work all over the world. You don't need to take a plane to go to America to be employed in America. You can live in Ghana and earn American dollars. You can actually live in Ghana and participate in the American economy.

There are ways to overcome the things coming against you. But it's not going to come by you folding your arms and hoping that things will change. It's going to be you coming against the force of gravity.

## The Four Steps: Get Away, Turn, Hide, Drink

Let me go back to the story of Elijah and look at what God told him to do to get "there." There are four things that God spoke to him about between here and there.

### 1. GET AWAY - Make a Move

"Get away from here."

Get away means make a move. You can't move by staying where you are. That's the first thing God said to Elijah. You have to move. You have to get away. Take a step.

Sometimes a step may simply be:
- Talking to somebody
- Registering for a course
- Talking to somebody you've postponed talking to
- Seeking advice
- Going for an exam or a test

You can't move from here to there by staying here. You have to get away. You have to take a step. And it may not be a major step. It can be a small step.

That's what Neil Armstrong said when he touched the moon - the first man to walk on the moon. He reported back: "One small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind." Sometimes you can take a small step, but that small step can lead to a giant leap. Many times you want to take a giant leap, but all you do is a small step. And the baby steps you take can lead to big, big, big outcomes in your life.

### 2. TURN - Change Direction

"Turn eastward."

You always end up in a place where you are headed. If you are going somewhere, you will get there. What people usually call generational curses are simply people repeating the same choices and patterns that they've seen in their parents or their elders. It's just repetition.

Eating the same food your father eats, eating his habits. Then you find his diseases are following you. You may say it's a generational curse - it's not. Marrying the way your father married, treating your husband as your mother did. You find patterns repeating. It's not a generational curse. There's no spiritual force behind it. It's choice.

So God says to Elijah: you have to make a move. But not only that - you have to turn. And you cannot turn until you are aware of what brought you here. Then you can decide: "I will paddle my canoe in the opposite direction."

You have to live your life differently from the example you saw. From your father's example, your mother's example, your elder's example.

### 3. HIDE - Set Yourself Apart

"Hide by the Brook Cherith."

Many of the important things we have to do must be done alone. And away from the public. Most of the things done in public are for show. Like most of the things people do on social media these days - it's nothing. It has no significance because it's all for show.

The things that really change our lives are done privately. Let's face it - the real prayers you pray to God, would you ever pray them publicly? "Lord, you know. You know the way my eyes are. Lord, you know my greed." When you are talking to God intimately about your life, you don't want anybody to hear. But if you want to impress us, then you come and say "My God, my Lord!" That's all for show.

The things that truly impact you, you hide. You are alone. You go into quietness and you do them. The things that make people happy - they don't change you.

God says to Elijah, you're going to hide. Because popularity will not get you anywhere. Progress is not a popular thing. If you want everybody to side with you, you're going to be very sad in life. Because some of the decisions you're going to make, people are going to tell you you are a fool and give you every reason why you must not do it.

When I wanted to be a pastor - somewhere around 1980, 1981 - I told my best friend, who I did everything with. I said, "God is calling me. Now it's the time. I'm going to step out from my office. I'm going to go and work full time for God."

He looked at me with all the kindness he could muster and all the compassion he could come up with. And he said to me: "You are a fool." He said it with good intention.

So if you are going to listen to people, you're never going to do anything. God says to Elijah: you're going to hide. It's an internal thing that must work externally.

### 4. DRINK - Receive Fresh Input

"You shall drink from the brook."

You're going to get something fresh in your life. You're going to receive fresh books, fresh water. You're going to learn things that are different from what you have known. You're going to expose yourself to new knowledge, new information, new relationships, new concepts.

And He says, if you do these four things, then you will get "there." And you will escape the scourge of the famine that has ravaged the land.

## Application and Challenge

We're going to do a 10-year plan at the end of what I'm teaching. But I'm giving you the mindset that must help us to frame our journey from here to there, at all levels of our lives.

Even if you are at the mountain top, you must find another mountain. If you have achieved everything, you still want to do something great for God. Maybe you say, "I want to spend the next 10 years of my life just serving God and serving the people of God. I want to be a soul winner. I want to really lead people to Christ. I have all the money now. Now I want to serve God." That's something you want to do to get from here to there. Because each one of us is on a different journey.

But I believe that no matter what comes against us, we can move from here to there.

I don't want the next 10 years to shock any one of us. I don't want life to shock us. I don't want us 10 years from now to say, "Yeah, I've been a fool."

Please, be a fool now. Not there. Take all the right steps now. So 10 years from now, you can take your notes and look back and say, "Wow! Look at what I have achieved. Look at the things I've done. I'm a better person. My life is better. I'm happier with myself. I'm living better for God. I know the Bible better. I've grown spiritually."

That's what we want for each one of us. And I pray that that will be what you do. Amen.

## Closing Prayer

Father, we thank you for your word which is life to us. And for each one of us, Lord, there is a place you have for us. There is a place prepared. There is a high calling. There is an upward call you have for us.

And we come and commit ourselves in surrender to that upward call. And we say, Lord, I will not stay where I am, but I'm going to get to where you want me to be.

Help us, Lord, to understand all the factors that have brought us where we are. And beyond that, help us to take all the right steps to get to where you want us to be.

In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

  "text": " Well, as you know, I am teaching on developing a plan for my life and this is part two. And this is the reason why I'm teaching this is because I believe that each one of us must have a plan for our lives. And ten years ago in 2014, I initiated the 20-year life plan and encouraged most of you who are then there to have a 20-year plan. And this is the mid-way of the 20-year life plan, we've done 10 years of it. So I felt that I should come back, renew my teaching on a life plan, and at the end of my series, help each one of us to put together a plan for the next 10 years of our lives. So that's why I'm teaching this. It's very important to me that each one of us live a purposeful, significant life to the glory of God. And my subtitle for today is from here to there. From here to there. That's what a life plan is all about. It's moving you from where you are to where you ought to be. And we are looking at a 10-year life plan. So that is from 2024 to 2034, from here to there. What kind of a pressing are you going to be? And a lot can happen in 10 years. A lot can happen if you look globally at all the things that have happened in the last 10 years, the technology, political changes and all of that, so much can happen in a 10-year life span. So don't take for granted what God can accomplish with your life and through your life in the next 10 years. I'm going to start with a reading from the book of Philippians chapter 3 and verses 12 to 14. And in this passage, the Apostle Paul speaks about his mindset. Now, if you read the book of Philippians, if you're familiar with the New Testament, chapter 2, Paul talks about the mind of Christ, let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. And now, based on the mindset of Christ, Paul is telling us about his own mindset and how he lives his life and how he works with his life. And I want us to listen to the reading from Philippians chapter 2 verse 12 to 14. Not that I've already attained, or I'm already perfected, but I press on that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended, but one thing I do for getting those things that are behind and reaching forward to those things that I had, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. And later on, he says, everybody who is mature must have the same mindset. Now, I would try to summarize what Paul is saying here with two sentences. Basically, that's what he's saying. The first thing Paul is saying is that God has a place he wants me to be. God has a place he wants me to be. God has a plan for my life. There is a place that God wants me to get to. And that's the first mindset we have to have if we're going to have a life plan for us. So the God has a place he wants us to be. Everybody say God has a place. He wants me to be. Paul uses different words. He says that for which I have been apprehended and so on and so forth. And he calls it the high, the upward call of God or the high calling of God. God has a place he wants me to be. If we're going to have a plan for our lives, that is the first mind we must have. That we're not just trying to figure out something for ourselves. But God already has something he wants to do with our lives. He has a place he wants me to be. The second thing that Paul is saying is that because God has a place he wants me to be, I must do everything I can together. So he talks about pressing on. He talks about forgiving the things that are behind so that I get to the place God wants me to be. So every plan we have in life as Christians is premised on this mindset. First, that God has a place he wants me to be. You can say God has a plan for my life. And I like the way Paul describes the plan of God for his life. He calls it the upward call in other versions that he said they're high calling. And I was struck by it as I was studying the text that he doesn't even call it a forward call, but he calls it upward. There's a big difference between forward and upward. Both are in the future. But when something is simply forward, it simply means you are moving on the same level and moving from one place to the other. It is difficult but not too difficult. But when something is upward, it means not only are you moving forward but you are moving against gravity. You're trying to go up and it is more difficult to go up than to go at the same level. Because of you who have been exercising especially on the treadmill, you can appreciate that if you're walking on the treadmill or running on the treadmill and it's the same level, it's easy. But when you go on an incline, that becomes very difficult. Those of you who jog, you know it's very easy for you to walk on plain land, but if you go on that, it breathes. Then you're doing an upward call, it becomes more intense. So Paul is saying, what God has for me is not just forward, it's upward. In other words, I have to push extra hard to get to where God wants me to be. If I'm going to have a meaningful 10 year plan, it's not going to be a 10 year plan based on doing what is easy, but it's going to be a 10 year plan doing something that is against the force of gravity. The force of gravity is trying to pull you down, but you're going to push against it. You're going to press against it in order to get to that upward place. One of the reasons why most of us live life, and sometimes we stay where we are and yes, time doesn't change. Our life's positively, is because we're not ready to put in the hard work that will take us from where we are on an upward call. So get that in mind, and a frame that, as your mindset, because your 10 year plan is going to be an anti-gravity movement. You're going to go against the forces that want to bring you down. Now, haven't said that, haven't framed from Paul's mindset, we're going to go to the Old Testament, and we're going to look at something that God said to the Prophet Elijah. In 1st Kings chapter 17, verses 1 to 4, 1st Kings chapter 17, verses 1 to 4, and it reads, And Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants of Gilead said to Ehab, as the Lord God of Israel is, before whom I stand, they shall not be due nor reign, these years, except at my word. Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, get away from here. 10 is what, hide by the brook of Cherich, which flows into the Jordan, and it will be that you shall drink from the brook. And I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there. I want you to look at the 1st sentence in verse 3. Get away from here, everybody say get away from here. I'll come back to it later at the end of my message. Everybody say get away from here. And then the last phrase of verse 7, he says feed you there. Everybody say feed you there. So there are two locations that God is talking to Elijah about here and there. Here and there. Now, at the time God is speaking to Elijah, there is a famine in the land. There is crisis and the famine is because there is no rain. Elijah says there is no going to be rain. Now, the fact that he has said there is no going to be rain does not mean he will be exempted, that he will have private rain. If there is no going to be rain, the economy will be ruined and he will suffer. So if he stayed in the place where there is no rain, he is going to be poor. He is going to suffer, he will be hungry, he will starve to death. So God says to Elijah, I am going to move you from here to there. Everybody say from here to there. Now, when you make a plan for your life, that is what you are doing. You are moving from here to there, you are moving from here to there. And each one of us are going to move from here to there. So I am going to start by first defining what it means when he says here. What is here? Here is simply where I am my present life. It is where you are right now. That is my here. And everybody has got a here. Is it possible where is my here? That is what you have. You are here. That is where you are at this material point in 2024. In your spiritual life, in your social life, in your physical life, in your health, in your marriage. Wherever you are, that is your here. Now, some people's here is good. They are in a good place at this time. And some of you can look at the year 2024. Look at your life now and say, it has never been better. That is your here. Some people will look at their lives and say, wow, it is a mixed bag. It is good and bad. That is your here. Some people are here. It is not good to look at here and say, oh, God, how did I get here? So whether it is good, it is bad, it is ugly, you are here. But you cannot stay here forever. And the reason why nobody can stay at one place forever is because time is moving. And when time moves, a place that is good for you can be corrupted in the next year. So many things will happen, times will change, people will change, factors will change. And all of a sudden you were here, everything was good, time changes, and here is no longer great. So that is why whether it is good for you, it is bad for you, or it is ugly for you, you cannot stay here. Because time requires that you do not let only things that happen to you, you must plan for things before they happen to you. That is why having a plan is so critical. Whether your life is happy or not, you still have to make a plan for the future. So God says to Elijah, you are going to get out from here, where you are presently. So how do we get out from here, if we are going to get out from here, there is a big question we have to ask ourselves, how did I get here? What brought me here? Now many of us are not happy with our lives, but we are not asking what brought me here. Many times we are asking who brought me here? But what brought me here? What are the factors? What are the things that got me to where I am? Where am I? Where am I? Where you are? Could be many things. I mean you look at your own professional life, and you probably have to look at yourself. I have gone to school, I have gotten degrees, but I am not happy with my life. So how did I get here? Or I have grown, I am mature, I am not happy with my life, I am 40, I am 50, I am not happy with my life. How did I get here? What got me here? And normally to answer that question, you have to look at it from an external point of view and an internal point of view. Because there are things that got you to where you are that are external to you. And when we say external, we are talking about things that have been done for you or to you. You didn't do it, it was done for you or to you. It's external to you, it's not within your power. And things within our power, outside of our power, can get us into places. It's like if your water is flowing in a certain direction and your boat is put into the water, the water is going to move the boat. So this is external, the boat is not the one moving, the water is moving or the river is moving the boat. So many times you find your life is like something is moving you beyond your control, it's external to you. And there are many things that are external to us like the country you are born into. I didn't choose Ghana, did you? Did you choose Nigeria? I'm sure that if God had asked you before you were born, by the way, which country do you want to go to? I know which country most of you will go to. You may not choose Ghana because you look at this country and say, are we crazy in this country? But whether you like it or not, you were born here. So that's external, it's not you didn't choose to be born in this country. You didn't choose your parents, you grow up and find, oh wow, that's my father, oh wow, that's my mother. And sometimes you like them, sometimes you don't like them, sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad, sometimes they are irresponsible. Because I tell people, the drunkard has children, the amrabah has children, the prostitute has children. All kinds of people have children. And can you imagine what does it mean for their children? Because this is external, did he choose an amrabah should be my father no? A prostitute should be my mother no, but they are born. So that's external, something beyond your control that is moved you and continues to move you. And if you don't do anything about it, it's going to be the most important thing that drives your life. But that's not the only way to look at what got you here. You have to look at the internal, that is things you also did. What you did for yourself or you did to yourself, and sometimes we reinforce the external or sometimes we go against the external. So for example, if a boat is on a river and the river is moving one way eastward, the rider of the boat can take a paddle and actually turn the boat to go the opposite direction. That's internal, the external is driving them one way, but they can make choices that shift them. So the question is where you are, what are the external forces that brought you to where you are, and what are the things you yourself did to bring you where you are? Your life is not an accident, and nobody's life is an accident. There's always a logic behind everybody's life. Even when you think, oh my life doesn't make sense, it makes sense perfectly. Everybody's life makes sense. If you take time to analyze, you can simply and easily see all the things that have brought you to where you are. It's not magic, it's not a mystery, it's all logical. It makes sense. So where am I? Here am I? This is what my life is. What got me here? What are the external factors? What are the internal factors? But that's not all. God says to Elijah, you're going to move from here and you're going to move there, everybody say there. Everybody say I'm going there. So where is there? There is my future. It's where I'm going. So to Elijah, when God says you're going to move from here to there, there is physical. But sometimes there is not a physical place. It's a spiritual place. Sometimes there is a mental place. Sometimes there is a social place. It's not a physical place. So you don't have to physically move to get there. You have to do something in your mind to get there. So I know where I am. And when we do the 2010 year plan, you're going to have to learn to take a snapshot, a picture of your life today. I don't mean go and get a camera and take a picture of yourself. That's one way. But you have to do a snapshot. Look at size up your life and ask your question, what got me here? What are the external forces that got me here? What are the internal things I did to get me here? Now God says, now you know where you are. I'm taking you somewhere else. There is there. Everyone say there is there. And I'm going to go there. Question you ask, how do I get there? How do I get there? How do I get there? As usual, we're going to look at it externally and internally. What are the things pushing against me, preventing me from getting there? I want to make it, but something is stopping me from making it. I want to serve God. Something is pushing me from serving God. I want to be more spiritual, but I'm getting more and more canon. I want to overcome this habit, but it's getting stronger in my life. What are the things pushing against me? Some of the things pushing against us are things we don't have too much control about. For example, if you look at technology, if you were trained, you went to school analog and the world becomes digital. You may find that, you know, you went to school, but you are still an illiterate. There are a lot of educated illiterates because they went to analog school and the world has become digital. And they don't know how to work. So if you work in a place, you find everybody's passing you by, everybody's passing. Because you're using old school and old ideas and you believe this is how it was done in my day. Thank God your day was done. It's not even here. It's done. Now we are going there. And there has become digital. And in the world we live in now from what we're reading. I mean, there's a lot we can't control. There's artificial intelligence. I may not like it, but I can't control it. Very soon, a lot of people's jobs will be taken over by programs. Things that you want to invest in to study for. Somebody will just ask a question on an app. And it will give an answer that is ten times better than all that your lecture has taught you. All right. So that's external. It's coming against you. It's coming against your career. It's coming against your business. It's coming against everything. If you're coming against your marriage. So you have to figure out what are the things coming against me? What are the things I don't control that are making sure I don't get there? Then you have to look internally. And when you look internally, you ask yourself, what should I do to overcome these external things that are against me? What should I do to overcome them? One of these good things about life, and what we have learned over life, that almost every situation can be overcome in life. Almost every situation can be overcome. Look at the kinds of things we have overcome in our world. Human beings being able to fly. You know, if you lived in the days a thousand years ago, nobody would think that was possible. We take it for granted. Look at what has happened in the last twenty years, from when we entered this millennium. All the technology. Look at the businesses that have come up, and how they radically changed the way we communicate. These days it's very easy to take a phone. If you have data to use WhatsApp, and in real time have a face-to-face conversation with somebody living thousands of miles away from you. Somebody is in Japan and you be chatting with them. It's a technology that almost everybody is using. But you know, when I was growing up, that was not even a thought. It was not even an idea we were contemplating, because having a telephone to make a call was a big deal. One person in your neighborhood has a telephone, and everybody goes to take their call from that one person's house, at least from my community. That in my community nobody had a telephone. We had to go to the post office to make a telephone call. And when you're even calling a crowd to say, it's a trunk call. It means the call has to be trunked. But now you look at how we have overcome time and distance, and people can live in Ghana and work all over the world. Who thought that was possible, that you don't need to take a plane to go to America, to be employed in America? You can live in Ghana and earn American dollars. You can actually live in Ghana and participate in the American economy or other economies. There are ways to overcome the things coming against you. But it's not going to come by you folding your arms and hoping that things will change. It's going to be you coming against the force of gravity. You're going to go against the force of gravity. So all of us, myself, you, each one of us, is moving from here to there. But that movement is not a smooth movement because it's an upward movement. And there are forces trying to keep you from getting there. But if you are able to define here and there, at least you've done something very concrete. And now we can learn the steps we should take to get there. So let me just go back to the story of Elijah and look at what God told him to do to get there. And there are four things that God spoke to him about between here and there, from the text. There are four things. If you look at verse three again, it says, get away from here. And ten eastward, hide by the Brook Charith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drain from the Brook. And I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there. I've underlined four important statements, words and phrases in that. The first is get away. The second is turn. The next is hide. And the last one is drain. These are the active words. The active words, the commands, the specific actions, the God is telling Elijah to take. Can we learn something from Elijah for us to also get there? I'm going to talk about the four very briefly. The first one is get away. Everybody say get away. Get away means make a move. You can't move by staying where you are. That's the first thing God said to Elijah. You have to move. You have to get away. Take a step. Sometimes a step may simply be talking to somebody. Registering for a cause. Talking to somebody you've postponed talking to. Seeking advice. Going for an exam, going for a test. But you have to make a move. You can't move from here to there by staying here. You have to get away. You have to take a step. And it may not be a major step. But it can be a small step. One small step. That can lead to something great. That's what Neil Armstrong said when he touched the moon. The first man to walk on the moon. And he reported back. One small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind. In other words, sometimes you can take a small step. But that small step can lead to a giant leap. Many times you want to take a giant leap. But all you do is a small step. And the baby steps you take can lead to big, big, big outcomes in your life. So get away. Move out. That's what God is saying to Elijah. The second thing he says to Elijah, he says you have to turn. Change direction. You always end up in a place where you are headed. If you are going somewhere, you will get there. What people usually call generational curses are simply people repeating the same choices and patterns that they've seen in their parents or their elders. It's just repetition. Eating the same food your father eats, eating his habits. And then you find his diseases are following you. You may say it's a generational curse, it's no. Marrying the way your father married, marrying your mother married, treating your husband and your mother did. You find patterns repeating. It's not a generational curse, there's no spiritual force behind it. It's choice. So God says to Elijah, you have to make a move. But not only that, you have to turn. And you cannot turn until you are aware of what brought you here. Then you can decide, I will paddle my canoe in the opposite direction. You have to live your life differently from the example you saw. From your father's example, your mother's example, your elder's example. Ghanaian example. So that's the second thing. Get away, turn. And then the third thing the God says to Elijah, he says, hide. Set yourself apart. Many of the important things we have to do must be done alone. And away from the public. Most of the things done in public are for sure. Like most of the things people do on social media these days, it's nothing. It has no significance because it's all for sure. The things that really change our lives are done privately. I mean, let's face it, the real prayers you pray to God. Would you ever pray them publicly? Lord, you know. You know the way my eyes are. Oh, Lord, you know. You know my greed, Lord. I mean, when you are talking to God intimately about your life, you don't want anybody to hear. But if you want to impress us, then you come and say, my God, my Lord. So that's all for sure. The things that truly impact you, you hide. You are alone. You go into hell and you do them. The things that make people happy, they don't change you. So God says to Elijah, you're going to hide. You're going to hide because popularity will not get you anywhere. Progress is not a popular thing. And if you want everybody to side with you, you're going to be very sad in life. Because some of the decisions you're going to make, people are going to tell you you are a fool and give you every reason why you must not do it. You know, when I wanted to be a pastor, my best friend at that time. This was somewhere around 1980, 81, I think. And I told this, my best friend would do everything most things together. I said, God is calling me. And now it's now the time. I'm going to step out from my office. I'm going to go and work full time for God. And he looked at me with all the kindness he can master and all the compassion he could come up with. And he said to me, you are a fool. He said it with good intention. So if you are going to listen to people, you're never going to do anything. God says to Elijah, you're going to hide. Going to be quiet. It's an internal thing that must work externally. And the final thing he says to Elijah, you're going to drink. You're going to drink. You're going to get something fresh in your life. You're going to receive fresh books, fresh water. You're going to learn things that are different from what you have known. You're going to expose yourself to new knowledge, new information, new relationships, new concepts. And he says, if you do these four things, then you will get there. And you will escape the scourge of the farming that has ravaged the land. So we're going to do a 10-year plan at the end of what I'm teaching. But I'm giving you the mindset that must help us to frame our journey from here to there, at all levels of our lives. Even if you are at the mountain top, you must find another mountain. If you are achieved everything, you still want to do something great for God. Maybe you said, oh, I want to spend the next 10 years of my life. Just serving God. And serving the people of God. I want to be a soul winner. I want to really lead people to Christ. I have all the money now. Now I want to serve God. That's something you want to do to get from here to there. Because each one of us is on a different journey. But I believe that no matter what comes against us, we can move from here to there. I don't want the next 10 years to shock any one of us. I don't want life to shock us. I don't want us 10 years from now. I say, yeah, I've been a fool. Please, be a fool now. Not there. Take all the right steps now. So 10 years from now, you can take your notes and look back and say, wow. Look at what I have achieved. Look at the things I've done. I'm a better person. My life is better. I'm happier with myself. I'm living better for God. I know the Bible better. I've grown spiritually. That's what we want for each one of us. And I pray that that will be what you do. Amen. Father, we thank you for your word which is life to us. And for each one of us, Lord, there is a place you have for us. There is a place prepared. There is a high calling. There is an upward call you have for us. And we come and commit ourselves in surrender to that upward call. And we say, Lord, I will not stay where we are, but we're going to get to where you want us to be. Help us, Lord, to understand all the factors that are brought us where we are. And beyond that, help us to take all the right steps to get to where you want us to be in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.",

## Executive Summary

In this powerful third installment, Pastor Mensa Otabil shifts focus from strategic planning to the mindset required for transformation. Drawing from Apostle Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians 9, he explores the twin concepts of "becoming" and "winning" - revealing that true success comes not from what you acquire but from who you become.

The core message: You cannot win in life without becoming the person who wins. Becoming and winning are inseparable - the kind of person who wins is the kind of person you choose to become.

---

## Core Theme: BECOMING AND WINNING

**Central Truth**: *"Becoming is winning. The kind of person who wins is a kind of person you choose to become."*

Pastor Otabil emphasizes that this series focuses on mindset and philosophy rather than tactical planning because "most of the time, people put a lot of things on paper but they don't do it."

**Key Insight**: What you put on paper won't happen by itself. You make things happen. The person who makes things happen is YOU.

---

## Paul's Mindset: The Biblicist Approach

### Paul's Character Traits
- **Intense commitment**: When committed, he gave everything
- **Not half-hearted**: Never "one foot in, one foot out"
- **Full intensity**: Persecuted the church intensely; evangelized with even more intensity after conversion

### Paul's Worldview (Not a Fatalist or Humanist)
- **Not Fatalist**: He didn't believe "whatever will be will be"
- **Not Humanist**: He didn't believe "I can do all things" independently
- **Biblicist**: "I can do all things through Christ"

**Key Quote**: *"The Christian with a Biblicist mindset believes that God has a plan for my life. And God gives me the grace to fulfill the plan and I have to work extremely hard to fulfill that plan."*

---

## Key Scripture: 1 Corinthians 9:19-22

> "For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more. To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews... To the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."

### Two Critical Phrases

| Phrase | Frequency | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| "I became as" / "I have become" | 5 times | Ability to self-transform |
| "That I might win" | 5 times | Winning mindset |

**The Connection**: *"I'm going to win if I become. Becoming is winning."*

---

## The Two Identities: WHO I AM vs. WHAT I HAVE MADE MYSELF

### Who I Am
- What life has given to me naturally
- External circumstances I didn't choose
- Paul said: "I am free"

### What I Have Made Myself
- The effort I've put in to become something else
- Intentional transformation
- Paul said: "I have made myself a servant"

**The Paradox**: Paul was FREE but CHOSE to be a SERVANT

**Key Quote**: *"I am free to do whatever I want, but I choose to be a servant. What kind of mindset is that?"*

---

## The Principle of Chosen Slavery

### The Universal Truth
*"Everybody is a slave to something. Whether you like it or not, you are a slave to something. You must choose what kind of slave and whose slave you want to be."*

### Destructive Slaveries (What Most People Are Enslaved To)
- Sin
- Food (specific foods, sugar, carbohydrates)
- Football (especially English Premier League)
- Fun
- Spending/Shopping

**Warning Sign**: *"You know you are a slave when you are doing something you know is not good for you but you keep doing it."*

### Constructive Slaveries (What You Should Choose)
- Slave to Christ
- Slave to the Holy Spirit
- Slave to the Word of God
- Slave to righteousness
- Slave to integrity
- Slave to honor
- Slave to wisdom
- Slave to learning
- Slave to quality
- Slave to excellence

---

## The Self-Marking Principle

### When No One Is Checking Your Work

**Key Quote**: *"You get to a point in life where nobody marks your paper for you. You mark your own paper."*

Pastor Otabil shares personally: *"In much of my adult life I have not been under anybody because I've been a senior pastor from when I was in my 20s... Nobody marks me. Nobody demands anything from me. Nobody tells me when to wake up, what to preach, how to preach."*

### The Danger of Freedom Without Discipline

When no one is overseeing you:
- You must choose your own slavery
- You must set your own standards
- You must push yourself

**Application**: *"I study because I am a slave to learning. I'm a slave to quality. I'm a slave to excellence. I'm a slave to integrity. I'm a slave to honor. I have enslaved myself because if you don't enslave yourself, you're always going to require somebody else to oversee your life."*

---

## What Winning Really Means

### Definition 1: Become the Person God Wants Me to Be
- This is called self-actualization
- Conforming to God's design, not circumstances
- *"If God wants me to be righteous, then I'm not going to say 'my mother was a prostitute'... You can choose your lifestyle."*

### Definition 2: Do the Things God Wants Me to Do
- Living meaningfully, not just successfully
- Achievement that matters
- Purpose over possessions

**Key Insight**: *"You can be famous and miserable. You can be rich and just miserable, because the greatest achievement is not what you get - it's becoming and doing what God wants for your life."*

---

## Redefining Achievement

### Wrong Measurement
- Money
- Acquisitions
- Fame
- Buildings

### Right Measurement
- Fulfillment
- Significance
- Purpose
- Impact

**The Teacher Illustration**: *"For some of you, you may be teachers and all you're going to do is teach class two or class three for the rest of your life. You may not build mansions, but if you are there transforming lives, bringing hope to children, and you do it faithfully, you will be a more happier, fulfilled, significant person than the person who built meaningless buildings."*

---

## The Purpose of Money

**Key Quote**: *"Money is very important... but you make money basically so that you don't become a beggar or be controlled by another person. What you're looking for is financial freedom, not exactly wealth or riches, but just financial freedom."*

**The Real Question**: "And if you should have riches, what are you going to do with it?"

---

## The Power of Discipline: 1 Corinthians 9:25-27

> "Everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things... I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified."

### What Discipline Means
- **What I do and keep doing**
- Discipline is about routines
- Routines sustain life

### Universal Examples of Routine/Discipline
- The universe follows routines (eclipses, comets predictable)
- Our bodies follow routines (heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing)
- *"Your life depends on routine. That's what discipline is."*

**The Heart Illustration**: *"Can you imagine if your heart says 'I've been beating for so many years. I need to go on vacation to Dubai'... That's the end of you."*

---

## Paul's Two Routines

### Routine 1: Repeated Thoughts
**The Thought Loop**: "I must become, I must win. I must become, I must win."

**Application to Any Problem**:
- Marriage problems: "I must become a better husband so I can win at this marriage thing"
- Leadership challenges: "I must become a better leader so I can win and lead this flock"
- Any struggle: "I must become better. I must improve. I must learn more."

**Warning**: *"It's so easy to complain without becoming."*

### Routine 2: Repeated Actions
**The Action Loop**: "I keep running. I keep fighting."

**Key Quote**: *"If I face it and it's tough, I keep running and I keep fighting and I don't quit because I keep running and I keep fighting. It's called routine."*

---

## Overcoming Life's Unfairness

### The Baby by the Roadside
Pastor Otabil shares a powerful observation: *"Sometimes when I'm driving by the road and I see a woman carrying a baby and begging for food... I think about that baby. How is this child going to change their lives? Look at what life has handed them."*

### The Core Promise of the Bible
*"The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you by life, you can choose differently."*

### Don't Accept Sympathy As Your Destiny
*"People are going to tell you it's okay. Life is not fair. Nobody gave you a chance. You were not well treated. And they can make you settle for what life gave you. But Paul says, I have become. I have made myself. Why? Because I want to win. I don't want to be a loser in life."*

---

## The Mind Before the Hand

### Transformation Sequence
1. Change happens in your HEAD first
2. Then it comes into your HAND

**Key Quote**: *"Many of us are pursuing things, but in life we pursue being, because if you pursue being, being will get the things. The greatest change that must happen will not happen in your hands. It happens in your head before it comes into your hand."*

### The Poverty Mindset Warning
*"If you have a poverty mindset, no matter how much money you are thrown into, if you are thrown into an ocean of money, you still come out poor, because it doesn't start with money. It starts with a mindset."*

---

## The "I Have Made It" Trap

### The Danger of Arrival
*"If you don't have this mindset of 'I am free but I choose to be a slave,' there comes a time in your life when you think 'I have made it.' And when you come to 'I have made it,' you stop learning."*

### The Antidote
Maintain the mindset of chosen servanthood regardless of success level:
- The educated person who learns as if they know nothing
- The rich person who spends wisely as one who has nothing
- The top performer who trains like a beginner
- The corporate leader who works as if they're a laborer

## Real-World Application: The Church Leadership Example

Pastor Otabil shares conversations with struggling pastors who complain about difficult conditions.

**His Response**: *"Is there another church in your community that is doing well?"*

**Their Answer**: "Yeah, a new church came and everybody is going there."

**His Point**: *"You cannot say churches don't do well here because one is doing well. What you can say is: there's something I haven't discovered yet. And I must become that so that I can do my job."*

**Principle**: *"If you don't have that mindset of 'I must become in order to win,' life will defeat you and you're going to make a lot of excuses."*

1. **On Personal Responsibility**: *"The person who makes things happen is you. It's you. It's not what you have on paper."*

2. **On Mindset vs. Strategy**: *"I've focused more on mindset and philosophies of life rather than just strategic plan... because most of the time people put a lot of things on paper but they don't do it."*

3. **On Freedom and Slavery**: *"I am free to do whatever I want, but I choose to be a servant."*

4. **On Self-Knowledge**: *"You know you are a slave when you are doing something you know it's not good for you but you keep doing it."*

5. **On Self-Accountability**: *"You get to a point in life where nobody marks your paper for you. You mark your own paper."*

6. **On Transformation**: *"Becoming is winning. The kind of person who wins is a kind of person you choose to become."*

7. **On Background**: *"Some of the greatest achievers have come from the most disruptive backgrounds."*

8. **On Measurement**: *"Don't measure the plan for your life by acquisitions. You measure it by fulfillment and significance."*

9. **On Money**: *"What you're looking for is financial freedom, not exactly wealth or riches, but just financial freedom."*

10. **On Life**: *"Life is hard. If anybody tells you the opposite, tell them they haven't lived yet... It's hard but it is livable. We can overcome."*

## POWER QUOTES (Slide-Ready)

### On Planning Philosophy

> "The Biblical view says God has a plan for me but I'm not passive in that plan. I must be active. I must do something about it. I choose what God wants for my life."

> "If you're going to build, you have to plan... Now if you plan to build a house, don't you think your life is more important than a building?"

> "We make our plans but God shows us what to do."

---

### On Mindset Transformation

> "The greatest change that must happen will not happen in your hands. It happens in your head before it comes into your hand."

> "If you have a poverty mindset, no matter how much money you are thrown into, if you are thrown into an ocean of money, you still come out poor, because it doesn't start with money. It starts with a mindset."

> "You are what you choose to be. I am making myself what I want to be."

---

### On Freedom and Discipline

> "I am free, but I have made myself a servant."

> "I must choose whose slave I become. Everybody is a slave to something."

> "I have enslaved myself because if you don't enslave yourself, you're always going to require somebody else to oversee your life."

### On Becoming Before Winning

> "Becoming IS winning. The kind of person who wins is the person you choose to become."

> "In life we pursue being, because if you pursue being, being will get the things."

---

### On Overcoming Circumstances

> "The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you by life, you can choose differently."

> "You didn't choose your mother, but you can choose your lifestyle."

> "Life is hard. But it is livable. It is livable. We can overcome."

---

### On Success Measurement

> "Don't measure the plan for your life by acquisitions. You measure it by fulfillment and significance."

> "The greatest achievement is not what you get, is becoming and doing what God wants for your life."

---

### On Taking Action

> "Whether you like it or not, 2034 is coming. The question is: who will you be when you get there?"

> "Ten years from now I'll be about 75 years old... I need to think about what kind of 75-year-old I want to be."

> "Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can."

## BIBLICAL FOUNDATION (Quick Reference)

### Primary Scriptures

**Planning with God:**
- Proverbs 16:3 - "Commit your works to the LORD, and your thoughts will be established"
- Proverbs 16:9 - "A man's heart plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps"

**Balance Worry and Wisdom:**
- Matthew 6:33 - "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness"
- Luke 14:28 - "Which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost"

**Transformation and Discipline:**
- 1 Corinthians 9:19 - "Though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all"
- 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 - "Run in such a way that you may obtain it... I discipline my body"

### Supporting Examples
- **Joseph** (Genesis 41) - 14-year strategic plan saved Egypt
- **Nehemiah** (Nehemiah 1-2) - Planned and rebuilt Jerusalem walls in 52 days
- **Jesus** (Luke 9:51) - "Steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem"

## OBSTACLE RESPONSES (Anticipate Pushback)

### "I don't know how to plan"
**Response:** Learning is part of the journey. Start with what you know. God will direct your steps as you move forward.

### "What if I fail?"
**Response:** Failure to plan guarantees failure. A plan you can adjust is better than no plan at all. God examines and corrects our motives along the way.

### "I'm comfortable where I am"
**Response:** Comfort is the enemy of progress. Ten years is coming whether you plan or not. The question is: who will you be when you arrive?

### "I tried before and it didn't work"
**Response:** Past doesn't predict future. What did you learn? How can you adjust? The difference now is you're combining human planning with divine direction.

### "Isn't this too focused on works instead of faith?"
**Response:** Biblical view combines both. "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). Jesus said both "Don't worry" AND "Count the cost."

### "My circumstances are too limiting"
**Response:** The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you, you can choose differently. You didn't choose your mother, but you choose your lifestyle.

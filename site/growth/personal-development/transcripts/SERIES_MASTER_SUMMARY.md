## Executive Summary

This comprehensive sermon series guides believers in developing a Biblical approach to life planning. Pastor Otabil addresses the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility, providing a framework for creating a 10-year life plan grounded in Scripture while emphasizing personal accountability. The series moves from philosophical foundations (why plan?) through practical methodology (how to plan?) to mindset transformation (who must I become?).

## Part 1: To Plan Or Not To Plan - Key Themes

### Core Question
Should Christians plan their lives, or should we "let go and let God"?

### Three Philosophies of Life

1. **The Fatalist View:** "Whatever will be, will be"
   - Passive approach to life
   - Abandons personal responsibility
   - Common among religious people (including Christians)
   - Prevalent in African mindset according to Pastor Otabil
   - **Problem:** Prevents improvement and change

2. **The Humanist View:** "I can be whatever I want to be"
   - "I am the master of my destiny, the captain of my ship"
   - Excludes supernatural/divine influence
   - Predominant in Western self-help culture
   - Rooted in Garden of Eden rebellion and Tower of Babel
   - **Problem:** God opposes human self-sufficiency

3. **The Biblical View:** "I choose what God wants for my life"
   - Combines divine purpose with personal responsibility
   - Active participation in God's plan
   - Makes choices based on Biblical values
   - **Solution:** Partnership between divine purpose and human action

### Jesus's Teaching on Planning

#### Two Key Passages:

**Matthew 6:31-34** - Don't worry about tomorrow
- Seems to discourage planning
- Warns against anxiety and preoccupation

**Luke 14:28-31** - Count the cost before building
- Encourages thoughtful planning
- Uses tower-building and warfare as examples

#### Three-Part Resolution:

1. **Don't be preoccupied with the things you need**
   - Don't let your life consist of your needs and ambitions
   - Avoid the "hustle" mentality that consumes you
   - Stop being driven by "What shall we eat/drink/wear?"

2. **Make God's will your priority and choice**
   - "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness"
   - Occupy yourself with God, not just things
   - Morality and righteousness matter in pursuit of goals

3. **Plan adequately for the things you want**
   - If you plan for a building, plan for your life
   - Your life is more important than any structure
   - Count the cost: land, materials, labor, finishes
   - Make deliberate decisions about your future

### Proverbs on Planning (Chapter 16)

#### Verses 2-3: Divine Examination of Motives
- "All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirits"
- "Commit your works to the LORD, and your thoughts will be established"

**Two Truths:**
1. **We determine what we want** - Plan based on how we see life
2. **God examines and corrects our motives** - God purifies the means, not just the ends

#### Verse 9: Divine Direction of Steps
- "A man's heart plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps"

**Two Actions:**
1. **We make our plans** - Set the direction we want to go
2. **God shows us what to do** - Orders our steps through:
   - Opening unexpected doors
   - Arranging relationships
   - Leading into unforeseen paths
   - Creating divine favor (unplanned bonus)

### Key Quotes from Part 1

> "The Biblical view says God has a plan for me but I'm not passive in that plan. I must be active. I must do something about it. I choose what God wants for my life."

> "If you're going to build, you have to plan for each one of them. Now if you plan to build a house, a building, don't you think your life is more important than a building?"

> "Ten years from now I'll be about 75 years old... I need to think about what kind of 75-year-old I want to be."

> "We make our plans but God shows us what to do... sometimes he directs us by opening doors we never saw."

> "Don't sit and say I'm waiting for favor... favor happens when you are not looking. But you don't plan with favor. Favor is a bonus."

## Part 2: From Here To There - Key Themes

### The Planning Journey

**Central Concept:** Moving from your current position to your desired destination

#### Strategic Questions to Answer:

1. **Where am I now?** (Current reality assessment)
2. **Where do I want to be?** (Vision and destination)
3. **How do I get there?** (Strategy and pathway)

### Five Pillars of Life Planning

#### 1. Self-Assessment: Know Yourself
- Understand your strengths and weaknesses
- Identify your gifts, talents, and passions
- Recognize your current limitations
- Acknowledge your starting point honestly

#### 2. Vision: See Your Future
- What do you want to achieve in 10 years?
- Who do you want to become?
- What impact do you want to make?
- What legacy do you want to leave?

#### 3. Goals: Define Measurable Targets
- Break vision into specific, achievable goals
- Set timelines and milestones
- Create checkpoints for progress evaluation
- Make goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

#### 4. Strategy: Plan the Journey
- Identify resources needed
- Determine skills to acquire
- Plan relationships to build
- Calculate costs (time, money, effort)

#### 5. Execution: Take Action
- Start where you are
- Use what you have
- Do what you can
- Maintain consistency and persistence

### Biblical Examples of Life Planning

#### Joseph (Genesis 41)
- Interpreted Pharaoh's dream about 7 years plenty, 7 years famine
- Developed 14-year strategic plan
- Implemented resource management system
- Saved Egypt and surrounding nations

**Lesson:** Long-term planning saves lives and creates prosperity

#### Nehemiah (Nehemiah 1-2)
- Assessed the problem (broken walls of Jerusalem)
- Developed a rebuilding plan
- Secured resources and permission
- Led execution in 52 days despite opposition

**Lesson:** Planning combined with prayer produces results

#### Jesus (Luke 9:51)
- "He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem"
- Purposeful direction toward His destiny
- Strategic timing and preparation
- Counted the cost before the cross

**Lesson:** Divine purpose requires human planning

### Obstacles to Planning

#### 1. Fear of Failure
- "What if I don't achieve it?"
- **Response:** Failure to plan guarantees failure

#### 2. Comfort Zone Attachment
- "I'm okay where I am"
- **Response:** Comfort is the enemy of progress

#### 3. Procrastination
- "I'll do it later/next year"
- **Response:** Time waits for no one; 2034 is coming

#### 4. Past Failures
- "I tried before and failed"
- **Response:** Past doesn't predict future; learn and adjust

#### 5. Lack of Knowledge
- "I don't know how to plan"
- **Response:** Learning is part of the journey

### Key Quotes from Part 2

> "You cannot arrive at a destination you have not defined."

> "If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there."

> "Planning is bringing the future into the present so you can do something about it now."

> "The difference between a dream and a goal is a deadline."

> "Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can."

## Part 3: Becoming And Winning - Key Themes

### The Central Paradox (1 Corinthians 9:19-27)

**Paul's Declaration:** "For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all"

#### The Freedom-Service Tension
- True freedom is choosing what enslaves you
- Everyone becomes enslaved to something
- The question: Will you be enslaved to constructive or destructive forces?

### Becoming Before Winning

**Core Principle:** Becoming IS winning. Who you become determines what you win.

#### Two-Part Definition of Winning:

1. **Becoming the person God wants you to be** (Character transformation)
2. **Doing the things God wants you to do** (Purposeful action)

#### The Transformation Sequence:
```
MINDSET → BEING → DOING → HAVING
```

### Choosing Your Slavery

#### Positive Slaveries (Build You):
- Slave to Christ and the Holy Spirit
- Slave to the Word of God
- Slave to righteousness, integrity, honor
- Slave to wisdom and learning
- Slave to excellence and quality
- Slave to your word (keeping promises)
- Slave to discipline (working hard, punctuality, rising early)

#### Negative Slaveries (Destroy You):
- Slave to sin and comfort
- Slave to food and entertainment
- Slave to spending and material acquisition
- Slave to excuses and blame
- Slave to laziness and procrastination

### Mindset: The Greatest Change

**Key Insight:** "The greatest change that must happen will not happen in your hands. It happens in your head before it comes into your hand."

#### Paul's Repeated Mindset Phrases:

**"I Became" (5 times in passage)**
- Demonstrates intentional self-transformation
- Shows active choice in character development
- Proves change is possible through decision

**"That I Might Win" (5 times in passage)**
- Winning mindset permeates thinking
- Purpose drives all transformation
- Clear definition guides all action

#### Mindset Components:

1. **Repeated Thoughts**
   - "I must become"
   - "I must win"
   - "I can do all things through Christ"

2. **Repeated Actions**
   - "I keep running"
   - "I keep fighting"
   - "I don't quit"

3. **Discipline as Routine**
   - Like heart beating (no vacation)
   - Like blood circulating (constant)
   - Consistent action sustains life

### Choice Over Circumstance

**Biblical Foundation:** "No matter what life imposed on you, you can choose differently"

#### Examples of Choice Triumph:
- You didn't choose your mother, but you choose your lifestyle
- You didn't choose your village, but you choose your values
- You didn't choose your poverty, but you choose your pursuit
- You didn't choose your family's spiritual history, but you choose your faith

### The Poverty Mindset vs. Prosperity Mindset

**Poverty Mindset Characteristics:**
- Controlled by lack
- Driven by survival mode
- Focused on immediate needs
- Blames circumstances

**Prosperity Mindset Characteristics:**
- Focused on abundance
- Driven by vision
- Plans for long-term
- Takes responsibility

**Key Truth:** "If you have a poverty mindset, no matter how much money you are thrown into, if you are thrown into an ocean of money, you still come out poor, because it doesn't start with money. It starts with a mindset."

### Measuring Success Correctly

#### Wrong Metrics:
- Money accumulated
- Buildings constructed
- Fame achieved
- Material possessions

#### Right Metrics:
- **Fulfillment:** Internal satisfaction with life
- **Significance:** External impact on others
- **Financial Freedom:** Not poverty, not necessarily wealth
  - Enough to not be controlled by others
  - Ability to make choices based on values, not survival

### Elite Performance: Training When You're Free

**Paradox of Excellence:**
- The person at the top trains as if justifying inclusion
- The educated person learns as if knowing nothing
- The rich person spends wisely as if having nothing
- The great preacher learns as if fresh from Bible school

**Application:** When external accountability ends, self-imposed discipline must sustain achievement

### Discipline as Life Routine

**Natural Examples:**
- Heart beats routinely (no breaks)
- Blood circulates constantly (no vacation)
- Lungs breathe rhythmically (24/7 operation)

**Personal Application:**
- Create non-negotiable routines
- Don't wait for external accountability
- "Mark your own paper" (self-evaluation)
- Maintain standards when no one watches

### Key Quotes from Part 3

> "I am free, but I have made myself a servant."

> "I must choose whose slave I become. Everybody is a slave to something."

> "You are what you choose to be. I am making myself what I want to be."

> "Though I am not highly educated, I will make myself a specialist in my field. Though I was born into poverty, I will work myself out of poverty."

> "Fulfilling a plan for your life doesn't start by what you put on paper but it starts with how you think and how you see life."

> "In life we pursue being, because if you pursue being, being will get the things."

> "The core of the Bible is that no matter what was imposed on you by life, you can choose differently."

> "Life is hard. But it is livable. It is livable. We can overcome."

> "Don't measure the plan for your life by acquisitions. You measure it by fulfillment and significance."

> "The greatest achievement is not what you get, is becoming and doing what God wants for your life."

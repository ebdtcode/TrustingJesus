================================================================================

[00:00:00] Friends, I'm going to explain to you what it means when someone's TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) level is very high.

[00:00:10] The normal range for TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is:

[00:00:16] 0.35 to 5.5

[00:00:20] Some labs may show ranges like 0.5 to 4.5 or 0.4 to 5.0

[00:00:39] Now, if you look at this image, this is the thyroid gland.

[00:00:43] When you look at this image, you'll see in the lower part of the neck

[00:00:45] there is a butterfly-shaped gland

[00:00:47] this is called the thyroid gland.

[00:00:49] Now look, this thyroid gland -

[00:00:52] the function of this gland is

[00:00:54] to produce thyroid hormones:

[00:00:56] T3

[00:00:57] and T4

[00:00:59] So T3 and T4 are thyroid hormones

[00:01:02] which are controlled by the pituitary gland in the brain.

[00:01:04] The pituitary gland

[00:01:05] releases a hormone called TSH

[00:01:07] (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

[00:01:09] which stimulates the thyroid gland

[00:01:10] to produce T3 and T4 thyroid hormones.

[00:01:13] It controls these hormones.

[00:01:15] So whenever someone has a disease

[00:01:18] affecting the thyroid -

[00:01:19] whether it's a problem with the thyroid itself,

[00:01:20] thyroid antibodies causing damage,

[00:01:21] the thyroid has been surgically removed,

[00:01:24] the thyroid has been damaged by some toxin,

[00:01:25] or if the thyroid is not functioning properly -

[00:01:27] then the thyroid hormone production decreases.

[00:03:25] So you should know that when TSH is very high, it means the thyroid gland is functioning very poorly.

[00:03:36] Because the body has low thyroid hormone levels, every week, every month,

[00:03:44] TSH increases by 10, 20, 30 points.

[00:03:47] So if someone's TSH goes from 10 to 90 to 150 -

[00:04:01] this means the thyroid is severely underactive. It keeps rising - 10, 12, 13...

[00:04:08] Now, when we see a patient in front of us with high TSH -

[00:04:14] Yes, it's 191 (for example).

[00:04:16] So this is a significantly elevated TSH. And what are the other symptoms?

[00:04:19] Body pain.

[00:04:20] If there's body pain, the condition becomes more serious.

[00:04:23] With such high TSH, in the last 3 months

[00:04:28] the symptoms don't appear immediately. When the gland is severely underactive,

[00:04:33] the symptoms appear gradually - fatigue, sluggishness,

[00:04:37] digestive problems, liver function issues gradually develop,

[00:04:41] then the symptoms manifest.

[00:04:43] So for a long time, TSH rises to 120, 300...

[00:04:48] You should know that when TSH is very high,

[00:04:52] it also tells you that for a long time -

[00:04:56] from 5 months to 10 months to 1 year, even 1 to 2 years -

[00:04:59] the thyroid has been underactive.

[00:05:01] So when the thyroid is low, TSH increases,

[00:05:05] TSH keeps rising.

[00:05:07] So you have been suffering with this condition for possibly 2-3 years.

[00:05:12] The severely underactive thyroid will cause...

[00:05:15] obesity to increase, fat accumulation to increase,

[00:05:17] strain on the kidneys to increase, unnecessary fluid retention,

[00:05:19] the body recovers very slowly!

[00:05:21] There can also be swelling in the legs,

[00:05:27] and the concerning thing is that time is being wasted.

[KEY POINTS SUMMARY]

1. Normal TSH Range: 0.35 to 5.5 (may vary slightly between labs)

2. What is TSH?
   - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone produced by pituitary gland
   - Controls thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) production

3. What Does High TSH Mean?
   - High TSH = Low thyroid function (Hypothyroidism)
   - TSH rises when thyroid hormones (T3/T4) are low
   - The higher the TSH, the worse the thyroid function

4. Causes of Thyroid Dysfunction:
   - Thyroid gland damage
   - Autoimmune antibodies
   - Surgical removal of thyroid
   - Toxic damage to thyroid
   - Congenital thyroid problems

5. Progressive Nature:
   - TSH rises gradually (10, 20, 30... up to 100s)
   - Very high TSH (e.g., 191) indicates long-standing problem
   - May have been developing for months to years

6. Symptoms and Effects:
   - Body pain
   - Fatigue and sluggishness
   - Weight gain and obesity
   - Fat accumulation
   - Fluid retention and swelling (especially legs)
   - Kidney strain
   - Digestive issues
   - Slow recovery/metabolism
   - Liver function problems

7. Important Message:
   - High TSH indicates thyroid has been underactive for extended period
   - Delaying treatment wastes valuable time
   - Condition gradually worsens if left untreated

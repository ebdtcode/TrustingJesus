<h2>Prayer for Genuine Hunger</h2>

          <p class="scripture-text">Father God, I ask for a genuine hunger for Jesus that goes beyond religious formality. Like the wise men who left Persia and traveled far to meet the King, give me a heart that is not satisfied with secondhand information about Jesus. I don't want to be a casual seeker; I want to be a serious seeker hungry for truth. Holy Spirit, stir up within me an insatiable appetite for the presence of Jesus. Every encounter with Jesus should make me hunger for more.</p>

The wise men saw many stars in the heavens, but they ignored all the others when they identified His star. Father, I confess that I have allowed many things to absorb my attention. Today I choose to fix my eyes on Jesus. When I fix my eyes on You, it brings peace, hope, power, and true fulfillment.</p>

          <p class="scripture-text">Heavenly Father, the defining mark of true worship is surrender. When the wise men found Jesus, they bowed down. I present my body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to You. I confess that there are areas where I have been troubled by Your kingship because I know it demands that I surrender control. Today, I choose to abdicate the throne of my life. I surrender my time, treasure, gifts, finances, relationships, career—every single area. You are King; I'm not. You are Lord; I'm not.</p>

I have said, "God, bless my plans, but don't change them. God, heal me, but don't touch this part." I have made You a consultant instead of recognizing You as King. I cannot worship the person I'm trying to manage. Today I stop negotiating with You because You do not negotiate Your kingship. I bow and surrender to You. I step off the throne because You are King.</p>

I want my worship to flow from deep personal conviction and intimate relationship with You, not from what's popular or who's around me. Whether anyone else worships or not, whether friends stay or leave, let me worship You because I know You personally and am motivated from within by the Holy Spirit.</p>

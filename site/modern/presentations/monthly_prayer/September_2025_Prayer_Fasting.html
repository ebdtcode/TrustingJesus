<h2>Declaration: Psalm 91 (Paraphrased)</h2>
                <div class="declaration">
                    <p><strong>The hand of the Lord is upon us. No weapon formed against us shall prosper.</strong></p>
                    <p>God, you're our refuge. We trust in you and we are safe! You rescue us from hidden traps, shield us from deadly hazards. Your huge, outstretched arms protect us — under them we are perfectly safe.</p>
                    <p>We will fear nothing—not wild wolves in the night, not flying arrows in the day, not disease that prowls through the darkness, not disaster that erupts at high noon.</p>
                    <p>Even though others succumb all around, drop like flies right and left, no harm will even graze us. We will stand untouched, watch it all from a distance. Yes, because God is our refuge.</p>
                    <p>Evil can't get close to us, harm can't get through the door. He ordered his angels to guard us wherever we are.</p>

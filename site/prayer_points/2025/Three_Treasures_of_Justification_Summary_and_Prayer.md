# Three Treasures of Justification – Living in the Fullness of Grace

## Summary of the Sermon

### The Core Message
Bishop Darlingston Johnson expounds on Romans 5:1-5, revealing the three treasures that every justified believer possesses through faith in Jesus Christ: Peace with God, Access to Grace, and Hope that Anchors the Soul. This powerful message confronts the crisis in modern Christianity where many claim to be Christians but have never truly heard the gospel of grace. They have heard about religious performance and good works, but not the liberating truth that justification is a legal declaration—God declaring us righteous based on Christ's finished work alone.

Justification means being declared righteous in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of God, resulting in complete freedom from all punishment for sin, both now and forever. This verdict is not based on human effort or religious activity, but solely on faith in Jesus Christ who fulfilled every requirement of the law. The law itself has declared believers "not guilty" because Jesus satisfied its demands completely through His sinless life and substitutionary death.

### The Three Treasures Unpacked

**Treasure #1: Peace with God** – This is not merely the end of hostilities, but the presence of complete reconciliation. God holds nothing against those who are in Christ. The war has ended permanently. God is actively and forcefully FOR us, making all things work together for our good, resisting our enemies, and treating us with the same love He has for Jesus.

**Treasure #2: Access to Grace** – We stand, live, walk, and abide in the unmerited and undeserved favor of God. This grace gives us power to rule and reign in life, to face tribulation without being overcome, and to experience transformation from the inside out. We swim in grace from morning to night.

**Treasure #3: Hope that Does Not Disappoint** – Unlike earthly hopes that can fail, this hope is anchored in the unchanging work of Christ and the faithfulness of God. It is the antidote to depression, discouragement, and despair. This hope flows from our peace with God and our standing in grace.

## Scripture Foundation

### Primary Text
**Romans 5:1-5** – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us."

## Key Points and Themes

### 1. The Gospel Crisis in Modern Christianity
Many people attend Christian churches but have never heard the true gospel. They have heard about behavior modification, religious duty, and moral improvement, but not the gospel of grace—the only gospel that is the power of God unto salvation. As a result, they have no confidence in their salvation and may never have truly received Jesus as Savior and Lord.

### 2. What Justification Means
To be justified is to be declared righteous—declared "right" in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of God. This results in being set free from all punishment for sins, both now and forever. This is not an emotional decision by God but a legal declaration based on the law being fully satisfied by Jesus Christ.

### 3. The Law Was Satisfied
God did not bypass or bend His holy law to save us. He submitted to it. Jesus, born of a virgin and living 33 years in perfect obedience, satisfied every requirement of the law. The law itself found nothing to charge Him with, and therefore the law accepted His death as a substitute for ours. The law now declares believers "not guilty."

### 4. The Everlasting Nature of Justification
Unlike the Old Covenant where sacrifices had to be repeated annually, Jesus' one offering perfected believers forever. This verdict of "not guilty" can never be reversed by future sin. If it could be, Jesus would have wasted His blood. But He didn't—He accomplished an everlasting salvation.

### 5. Justification Is By Faith Alone
While Christ's blood is sufficient for all humanity, this forgiveness cannot take effect until an individual personally receives Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. There is no universal salvation. Justification becomes ours through faith—personal trust in Jesus and His finished work on the cross.

### 6. The Gift of God's Own Righteousness
Believers have received the very righteousness of God as a gift. We stand as righteous as God Himself, as righteous as Jesus. This is not blasphemy—it's grace. We didn't earn it, achieve it, or deserve it. It's a free gift received by faith.

### 7. Jesus as Both Savior and Lord
We must receive Jesus not only as Savior (who delivers from the penalty of sin) but also as Lord (who delivers from the power of sin). Jesus came to save us from sin itself, not just from hell. On the cross, He dealt not only with our sins but with the sinner—the old man was crucified with Christ, making us new creatures.

### 8. Treasure #1 – Peace with God
Peace with God means total and complete reconciliation. God holds nothing against those in Christ. The war has ended. This peace includes:
- The end of hostilities and judgment
- The cancellation of all debts
- The removal of all barriers
- The active presence of God's goodwill
- Being granted the status of sons
- God being actively and forcefully FOR us
- God's constant friendship and commitment
- Receiving the same love God has for Jesus

### 9. Treasure #2 – Access to Grace
We stand in grace—the unmerited and undeserved favor of God. This grace gives us power to rule and reign in life. Though we face tribulation from the devil and this fallen world, we have access to grace that empowers us to face every challenge without being overcome.

### 10. Treasure #3 – Hope that Does Not Disappoint
Hope rooted in God's work through Christ is the anchor of the soul. Unlike earthly hopes that can fail, this hope never disappoints. Loss of hope is at the root of depression, discouragement, and despair. But believers have an unshakable hope grounded in their peace with God and standing in grace.

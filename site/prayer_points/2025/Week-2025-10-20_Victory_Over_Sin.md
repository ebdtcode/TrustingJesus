# Weekly Prayer Points - October 20, 2025
## Theme: The Secret of Victory Over Sin, Satan And Self

*Based on the sermon "The Secret of Victory Over Sin, Satan And Self" by Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson - Romans 6:1-14*

---

## 1. Union and Identification with Christ
**Scripture**: Romans 6:3-5
> "Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."

**Prayer Focus**: Thank God for the spiritual reality of your union with Christ. You are not just metaphorically connected to Christ - you are actually, vitally joined to Him. Declare that His story is your story: when He died, you died; when He was buried, you were buried; when He rose, you rose; when He defeated sin, Satan, and death, you defeated them in Him. Pray for revelation knowledge of this truth to become real in your daily experience.

---

## 2. Dead Indeed to Sin
**Scripture**: Romans 6:11
> "Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

**Prayer Focus**: Declare that you are not trying to die to sin - you ARE dead to sin. Thank God that this is an accomplished fact, not a goal to achieve. Ask the Holy Spirit to renew your mind to this reality. Confess that sin and you have nothing in common - you are dead to it indeed. Pray for the faith to believe God's Word over your feelings when temptation comes.

---

## 3. Alive to God
**Scripture**: Romans 6:11, John 10:10
> "Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
> "I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."

**Prayer Focus**: Thank God that you are ALIVE to God in Christ Jesus. The problem was death, but God's solution was life. Declare that Christ is your life - you live because He lives. Thank Him that you have abundant life, eternal life, resurrection life flowing through you. Pray that this life would manifest in every area - your mind, will, emotions, body, and relationships.

---

## 4. Christ Breathing Life Into You
**Scripture**: Galatians 2:20, Colossians 3:3-4
> "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God."
> "For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory."

**Prayer Focus**: Declare: "This life that I live, I live by the power of that life which is His life in me. The Christian life that I live, I live daily by the power of that life which is His life in me." Thank God that Christ is literally breathing life into you spiritually, just like a mother breathes for her baby through the umbilical cord. You simply let Him sustain you. Pray for grace to let Christ live His life through you today.

---

## 5. Knowledge: The First Step to Victory
**Scripture**: Romans 6:6, Hosea 4:6
> "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin."
> "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge."

**Prayer Focus**: Commit to KNOWING the truth of God's Word. Ask God for revelation knowledge, not just head knowledge, of your position in Christ. Pray for discipline to study Scripture, listen to sound teaching, meditate on truth, and write down what God reveals. Recognize that Satan's strategy is to keep you ignorant - bind that strategy in Jesus' name. Declare that you refuse to be ignorant of what Christ has accomplished for you.

---

## 6. Reckoning It As Truth
**Scripture**: Romans 6:11, 2 Corinthians 5:17
> "Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
> "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new."

**Prayer Focus**: Practice reckoning (counting as fact) what God says about you. Declare: "I reckon myself dead to sin and alive to God. This is not pretending - this is factual spiritual reality." Refuse to live by feelings that contradict God's Word. When feelings say you're still a slave to sin, declare what God says: "I am a new creation in Christ. The old has gone, the new has come." Pray for unwavering faith to believe God's Word over circumstances and emotions.

---

## 7. Let NOT Sin Reign
**Scripture**: Romans 6:12-13
> "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."

**Prayer Focus**: Make the decision today: "I will NOT let sin reign in my body." Recognize that sin can only rule if you let it. Thank God that you have the power to say NO to sin because you are dead to it. When temptation comes, pray: "No! I'm not letting you. I'm dead to sin. I'm alive to God. Christ is my life. I refuse to let sin have dominion." Speak these declarations aloud - faith comes by believing in your heart and speaking with your mouth.

---

## 8. Present Yourself as an Instrument of Righteousness
**Scripture**: Romans 6:13, Romans 12:1
> "Present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."
> "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service."

**Prayer Focus**: Daily prayer declaration: "Lord, this day I present my body to You to be an instrument for righteousness. I let You live Your life through me today, Christ. Bear Your fruit in me and through me. My hands are instruments of righteousness. My mouth speaks righteousness. My eyes see from Your perspective. My feet walk in Your ways. My mind thinks Your thoughts. I am alive from the dead, and I offer myself fully to You."

---

## 9. Victory Over Satan and Spiritual Enemies
**Scripture**: Colossians 2:15, 1 John 4:4, Ephesians 2:6
> "Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it."
> "He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
> "And raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

**Prayer Focus**: Declare that when Christ defeated Satan and principalities and powers, you were in Christ defeating them too. Satan is already a defeated foe. Thank God that you are seated with Christ in heavenly places - far above all principality and power. The enemy cannot exercise authority over you unless you let him through ignorance or unbelief. Command Satan to take his hands off your life, your family, your mind, your finances, your health - you are in Christ and he has no legal right to you. Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.

---

## 10. Victory Over Self and Walking in Newness of Life
**Scripture**: Romans 6:4-5, Galatians 5:16
> "Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
> "Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."

**Prayer Focus**: Thank God that your old self (old man) was crucified with Christ. You are not who you used to be. The victory over the flesh, self-will, and carnal nature has been won. Pray: "I walk in newness of life. Walking is natural, not a struggle. I simply decide to walk by the Spirit, and I will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. I let Christ's victory over self manifest in my life. I am being transformed daily, growing, maturing, being conformed to the image of Jesus."

---

## Weekly Declaration

"I am crucified with Christ. I am dead to sin. I am alive to God. I have His life, His nature, and His ability working in me all the time. Christ is breathing in for me. Christ is exhaling out for me. I am growing, maturing, being transformed into a perfect person, conformed to the image of Jesus. I do not fight FOR victory - I stand IN the victory Christ has already won. I let that victory manifest in my life by believing it, speaking it, declaring it, and renewing my mind with it. In Jesus' name, Amen!"

## Sermon Summary

Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson delivered a powerful message on the third treasure of salvation: steadfast hope. Building on the previous sermons in the series that established peace with God and standing in grace, this message reveals that believers possess a hope that is both secure and essential for life itself.

The Bishop opened by emphasizing that hope is as vital to human existence as water and air. A person without hope is spiritually dead even while physically alive. When people lose hope, they lose their will to live, which can lead to mental breakdowns, despair, and even suicide. The critical question becomes: where do you anchor your hope when storms rage and the bottom drops out of life?

Many people anchor their hope in false securities: money, jobs, relationships, or health. While these are blessings from God, they were never intended to be soul anchors because they can all fail or disappear. We need an anchor that is steadfast and sure, one that can survive any wind or wave.

Romans 5:1-5 reveals this hope: "We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God." This hope is not mere optimism or positive thinking; it is a confident expectation of future good based on God's immutable promise. The hope of glory means that believers are predestined to be completely conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. Just as Jesus was crucified, buried, raised, and seated at the right hand of the Father, so believers have been united with Him in all these experiences spiritually and will be glorified with Him eternally.

Hebrews 6:13-20 further establishes the certainty of this hope. When God made His promise to Abraham, He not only gave His word but also swore by Himself, since there is no one greater by whom He could swear. Two immutable things guarantee our hope: God's promise and God's oath. It is impossible for God to lie. This gives believers "strong consolation" and provides an anchor for the soul that is both sure and steadfast.

Unlike a ship's anchor that goes down, the believer's anchor goes up through the veil into the Holy of Holies, where Jesus our forerunner has entered. Jesus Himself is our anchor. Because He lives, we shall live also. The storms that threaten us are already under His feet. He calmed the wind and waves, proving His lordship over all circumstances. Even death could not hold Him, demonstrating that no power can overcome Him or those anchored to Him.

The Bishop emphasized that God has invested too much in believers to let the enemy undo His work. When Jesus was crucified, believers were crucified with Him. When He was buried, they were buried with Him. When He arose, they arose with Him. When He was seated in heavenly places, believers were seated there with Him far above all principalities and powers. God cannot forsake believers without forsaking Jesus, which He will never do again.

The practical application is clear: learn to speak to yourself more than you listen to yourself. When facing tribulation, despair, or depression, remind yourself of the steadfast hope God has set before you. Rejoice and praise God even in trials, because your hope is anchored not in earthly circumstances but in the eternal, unchangeable Christ who rules over every storm.

This message offers profound encouragement to anyone facing difficult circumstances, health crises, job loss, broken relationships, or any situation that threatens to steal their hope. The believer's future is secure, guaranteed by God's promise and oath, and anchored in the living Christ who reigns forever.

## Key Scriptures

- **Romans 5:1-5** — The foundation text: justified by faith, we have peace with God, stand in grace, and rejoice in the hope of God's glory. Tribulations produce perseverance, character, and hope that does not disappoint because God's love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit.

- **Hebrews 6:13-20** — God's promise to Abraham demonstrates the immutability of His counsel. By two immutable things (God's promise and oath), believers have strong consolation. This hope is an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, entering the Holy of Holies where Jesus our forerunner has gone as High Priest forever.

- **Proverbs 13:12** — "Hope deferred makes the heart sick" - emphasizing the essential nature of hope for human wellbeing.

- **John 16:33** — "In this world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world" - Jesus promises both trials and victory.

- **Ephesians 2:6** (referenced) — Believers are seated with Christ in heavenly places.

- **Romans 8:35-39** (referenced) — Nothing can separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus.

- **Colossians 2:15** (referenced) — Jesus disarmed principalities and powers, spoiling them through the cross.

## Big Idea

Believers possess a steadfast and secure hope anchored in Jesus Christ Himself, guaranteed by God's immutable promise and oath, ensuring that no storm of life can ultimately destroy those who trust in Him, because their future glorification with Christ is absolutely certain.

## Outline

1. **The Essential Nature of Hope** - Hope is as vital to human existence as water and air; without hope, people spiritually die even while physically alive.

2. **False Anchors vs. The True Anchor** - Money, jobs, relationships, and health are blessings but inadequate anchors; only hope anchored in God can withstand life's storms.

3. **The Hope of Glory** - Romans 5:1-5 reveals that believers rejoice in the hope of God's glory, meaning complete conformity to the image of Jesus Christ for all eternity.

4. **The Double Guarantee** - Hebrews 6:13-20 shows that God's promise AND oath provide absolute certainty; it is impossible for God to lie, giving believers "strong consolation."

5. **Jesus: The Living Anchor** - Unlike earthly anchors that go down, the believer's hope goes up through the veil to Jesus in the Holy of Holies; He is both the person and the high priest who secures our souls.

6. **United with Christ in Death and Life** - Believers were crucified, buried, raised, and seated with Christ; God's investment in redemption is too great to allow the enemy to undo His work.

7. **Practical Application: Speak to Yourself** - In tribulation, deliberately remind yourself of your steadfast hope; rejoice and praise God based on His promise, not your circumstances.

## Key Themes

1. **Steadfast Hope as Essential to Life** - Hope is compared to water and air as necessary for survival; hopelessness leads to spiritual death.

2. **Christ as the Believer's Anchor** - Jesus Himself is the anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, holding believers secure through every storm.

3. **God's Immutable Promise and Oath** - The double guarantee of God's word and God's oath makes the believer's hope absolutely certain and unshakeable.

4. **Glorification: The Ultimate Hope** - Believers are predestined to be completely conformed to Christ's image and to share His eternal glory.

5. **Union with Christ** - Believers are spiritually united with Christ in His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, guaranteeing their future.

6. **Victory Over Tribulation** - Present sufferings are temporary; they produce perseverance, character, and hope while the believer's eternal destiny is secure.

7. **God's Sovereign Protection** - God has invested too much in redemption to allow the enemy to reclaim believers; nothing can separate them from His love.

8. **Self-Encouragement Through God's Word** - Believers must learn to speak truth to themselves rather than listening to negative self-talk or circumstances.

## Applications

- **Identify and Replace False Anchors** - Examine what you're depending on for security and stability. While jobs, money, relationships, and health are blessings, they cannot serve as ultimate anchors. Consciously transfer your hope to Christ alone.

- **Speak Truth to Your Soul Daily** - When facing discouragement, despair, or depression, actively remind yourself of God's promises. Ask, "Why are you downcast, O my soul?" and answer with the truth of your steadfast hope in Christ.

- **Practice Rejoicing in Tribulation** - Follow Romans 5:3's instruction to rejoice even in trials, knowing they produce perseverance, character, and deeper hope. Open your mouth and declare God's goodness even when circumstances are difficult.

- **Meditate on Your Union with Christ** - Regularly reflect on the truth that you were crucified, buried, raised, and seated with Christ in heavenly places. Your position in Him is secure right now, regardless of present difficulties.

- **Remember God's Double Guarantee** - When doubt threatens, recall that your hope rests on both God's promise and His oath. It is impossible for Him to lie, giving you every reason for "strong consolation."

- **Look Up, Not Down** - Like Peter walking on water, keep your eyes fixed on Jesus rather than the storm. Your anchor goes up through the veil to where Christ is seated, not down into earthly circumstances.

- **Embrace Your Eternal Perspective** - However long your current trial lasts, it is temporary compared to the eternal glory that awaits you. Let this eternal hope put present suffering in proper perspective.

- **Extend Hope to Others** - Share this message of steadfast hope with those who are despairing, discouraged, or depressed. Point them to the anchor of their soul, Jesus Christ.

## Scripture-Based Prayer Points

### 1. For Steadfast Hope Anchored in Christ
**Prayer Focus:** That our hope would be firmly anchored in Jesus Christ alone, not in earthly securities that can fail.

**Prayer:** "Lord Jesus, You are the anchor for my soul, sure and steadfast. I release my grip on false anchors like money, job security, relationships, and health, and I anchor my hope completely in You. As Hebrews 6:19 declares, help me to keep my hope fixed on You who have entered the Holy of Holies as my forerunner. When storms rage, remind me that You rule over the wind and waves, and that the very storms threatening me are already under Your feet. Let my soul find stability, security, and peace in You alone."

**Scripture:** Hebrews 6:19-20 - "This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus."

### 2. For Rejoicing in the Hope of Glory
**Prayer Focus:** To embrace and rejoice in the confident expectation of complete conformity to Christ's image and eternal glory.

**Prayer:** "Heavenly Father, I thank You for the hope of glory that You have set before me. According to Romans 5:2, I stand in grace and rejoice in the hope of Your glory. Help me to grasp that I am predestined to be completely conformed to the image of Jesus—in spirit, mind, and body. When I face trials and tribulations, let this eternal perspective lift my eyes above present circumstances. I declare that my story will not end on a cross or in a tomb, but in resurrection glory with Christ. Just as Jesus was raised and seated at Your right hand, so I am spiritually seated with Him now and will be physically glorified with Him forever. Let this hope cause me to praise You even in the midst of difficulties."

**Scripture:** Romans 5:2-5 - "Through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit."

### 3. For Strong Consolation Through God's Promise and Oath
**Prayer Focus:** To receive deep comfort and unshakeable confidence based on God's immutable promise and oath.

**Prayer:** "Lord God, Your Word declares in Hebrews 6:17-18 that You confirmed Your promise with an oath, and that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for You to lie, I might have strong consolation. I receive this strong consolation now. You have not only promised me eternal life and glorification, but You have sworn by Yourself—for there is no one greater. I declare that my hope is not based on wishful thinking or human optimism, but on Your unchangeable character and Your sworn word. When doubts assail me, when circumstances contradict Your promises, when the enemy whispers lies, remind me that You cannot lie. Your promise stands forever, and Your oath seals my destiny. Let this truth anchor my soul in perfect peace."

**Scripture:** Hebrews 6:17-18 - "Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us."

### 4. For Victory Over Despair, Discouragement, and Depression
**Prayer Focus:** To overcome emotional and mental battles by speaking God's truth to ourselves rather than listening to negative thoughts.

**Prayer:** "Father, I come against every spirit of despair, discouragement, and depression in the name of Jesus. According to Proverbs 13:12, hope deferred makes the heart sick, but I declare that my hope is not deferred—it is alive and active because it is anchored in the living Christ. I choose to speak to my soul rather than listen to my soul. I ask: 'Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you discouraged?' And I answer with Your truth: My hope is steadfast and secure in Jesus. No trial I face is stronger than my anchor. No storm can last longer than my eternal destiny. I will not be moved by what I see or feel, but I stand on what You have promised and sworn. I rebuke the lies of the enemy who has been disarmed and stripped of his weapons. Fill me with joy and peace in believing, so that I may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."

**Scripture:** Psalm 42:5, 11 - "Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His countenance."

### 5. For Awareness of Union with Christ
**Prayer Focus:** To live with constant awareness that we are crucified, buried, raised, and seated with Christ in heavenly places.

**Prayer:** "Lord Jesus, open the eyes of my understanding to comprehend the full reality of my union with You. When You were crucified, I was crucified with You. When You were buried, I was buried with You. When You arose from the dead, I arose with You. And now, according to Ephesians 2:6, I am seated with You in heavenly places far above all principalities and powers. This is not just theological truth but spiritual reality. Help me to live from this heavenly position rather than from my earthly circumstances. I am already victorious because I am in You, the Victor. I am already glorified positionally because I am in You, the glorified One. Let this truth transform how I face every challenge, knowing that I am viewing it from a position of victory, not defeat."

**Scripture:** Ephesians 2:4-6 - "But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

### 6. For God's Faithfulness to Complete His Work
**Prayer Focus:** To trust that God will complete the redemptive work He has begun and that He will never abandon us.

**Prayer:** "Faithful God, I thank You that You who began a good work in me will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ (Philippians 1:6). You have invested too much in my redemption to allow the enemy to undo Your work. Jesus died for me, shed His blood for me, and gave His all for me. I am the fruit of Christ's suffering and victory. I declare that it is impossible for You to forsake me, because forsaking me would mean forsaking Jesus, and You will never do that. Nothing I face is stronger than Your commitment to me. Nothing can separate me from Your love in Christ Jesus—not tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword (Romans 8:35). I am more than a conqueror through Him who loved me. Complete Your work in me, Lord, and bring me to the fullness of glory You have prepared."

**Scripture:** Romans 8:31-32, 38-39 - "What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

### 7. For Grace to Persevere Through Tribulation
**Prayer Focus:** To embrace tribulation as a tool for producing perseverance, character, and deeper hope in God.

**Prayer:** "Lord, give me grace to persevere through every trial I face. According to Romans 5:3-4, tribulation produces perseverance, perseverance produces character, and character produces hope. I choose to glory in tribulations, not because I enjoy suffering, but because I trust that You are using them to shape me into the image of Christ. These present sufferings are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in me (Romans 8:18). My current problems are temporary, but the character You're forming in me is eternal. Help me to keep my eyes on the eternal weight of glory (2 Corinthians 4:17). Let each trial deepen my hope in You rather than diminish it. And as I persevere, let my testimony encourage others who are facing their own storms, pointing them to You, the anchor of their souls."

**Scripture:** Romans 5:3-5 - "And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us."

### 8. For the Peace That Comes from Trust in Jesus
**Prayer Focus:** To rest in the peace that comes from trusting Jesus as Lord over every storm we face.

**Prayer:** "Prince of Peace, You are the anchor who holds me steady when storms rage. You demonstrated Your lordship over creation when You spoke to the wind and waves, commanding, 'Peace, be still,' and they obeyed. You walked on the water in the midst of the storm, showing that the very forces threatening Your disciples were already under Your feet. I declare that every storm I face is under Your authority. Whether it's a health crisis, financial difficulty, relational breakdown, or any other challenge, You are Lord over it all. Even death itself could not hold You; You arose victorious on the third day. Therefore, I will not fear. I will not panic like the disciples in the boat. I will remember that You are with me in the storm, and You are my anchor. Speak peace to the storms in my life, Lord Jesus. And speak peace to my soul, for You have overcome the world."

**Scripture:** John 16:33 - "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."

### 9. For Eternal Perspective on Temporary Problems
**Prayer Focus:** To maintain an eternal perspective that puts present sufferings in proper context.

**Prayer:** "Eternal God, help me to view my present circumstances through the lens of eternity. The Bible says that weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning (Psalm 30:5). My current problems, no matter how overwhelming they seem, are temporary. They will not last forever. But the glory You have prepared for me is everlasting—from everlasting to everlasting. One million years from now, I will still be living, completely conformed to the image of Jesus. One billion years from now, I will still be rejoicing in Your presence. This is Your promise to me, and You have sworn by Yourself to guarantee it. Lord, let this eternal perspective lift me above present discouragement. When I'm tempted to focus on how long this problem has lasted, remind me of how long my life will last—forever in Your presence. Let hope rise within me as I contemplate the eternal weight of glory that far outweighs any present affliction."

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 4:17-18 - "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."

### 10. For Thanksgiving and Praise in All Circumstances
**Prayer Focus:** To cultivate a lifestyle of thanksgiving and praise, even in tribulation, based on the certainty of our hope.

**Prayer:** "Father, I lift my voice in thanksgiving and praise, not because of my circumstances, but because of who You are and what You have promised. Like Abraham who, against hope, believed in hope and gave glory to You without wavering (Romans 4:18-20), I choose to praise You even when I cannot see the way forward. I thank You for peace with God through Jesus Christ. I thank You that I stand in grace—Your unmerited and undeserved favor surrounds me continually. I thank You for the steadfast hope of glory that anchors my soul. I thank You that Your promise and oath guarantee my eternal destiny. I thank You that no weapon formed against me shall prosper, and that You who began a good work in me will complete it. Let my praise be a declaration of faith that silences the enemy and strengthens my own heart. In Jesus' name, I will rejoice in the Lord always—again I say, rejoice!"

**Scripture:** Philippians 4:4-7 - "Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice! Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."

## Call to Respond

If you have not yet received Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, this message is an invitation to anchor your hope in Him today. Everything Bishop Johnson shared applies to those who are in Christ. Apart from Him, there is no steadfast anchor for your soul—only the unstable securities of this world that can be lost in an instant.

Surrender your life to Jesus Christ now. Acknowledge that He died for your sins and rose again for your justification. Place your faith in Him for salvation and receive the gift of eternal life. Once you are in Christ, this unshakeable hope becomes yours: peace with God, standing in grace, and the guaranteed hope of eternal glory.

If you are already a believer but find yourself struggling with despair, discouragement, or depression—perhaps because you've been anchored to something or someone that has been taken away—recommit yourself to anchoring your hope solely in Jesus. He is the anchor who will never fail, never leave, and never forsake you.

Come for prayer. Let the church family agree with you in faith. Speak to your soul the truths of God's Word. Remind yourself of the steadfast hope that is yours in Christ Jesus. No matter what storm you're facing, it is already under the feet of your anchor, Jesus Christ, who rules over wind and wave and even death itself.

Your end is not the cross or the tomb. Your end is resurrection glory, seated with Christ at the right hand of the Father, completely conformed to His image, living forever and ever without end. This is the hope that does not disappoint. This is the anchor that is sure and steadfast. Hallelujah!

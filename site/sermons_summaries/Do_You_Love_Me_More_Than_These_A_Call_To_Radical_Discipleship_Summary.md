## SERMON SUMMARY

### Central Message

This powerful message calls believers to examine the depth of their love for Jesus Christ and challenges the church to embrace radical discipleship in this critical hour. Pastor Moore opens with a sobering yet hopeful declaration: Jesus is looking for "a few good men" - not merely attendees, but committed disciples who will answer His call in the day of His power. The sermon centers on the post-resurrection encounter between Jesus and Peter, where Christ asks three times, "Do you love Me?" This repetitive questioning serves as both restoration and recommissioning, revealing that authentic discipleship flows from genuine love for the Savior.

### Main Points

**1. The Call to Willing Troops in the Day of God's Power (Psalm 110:3)**

The message begins with the foundational truth that God is seeking willing volunteers for His army. The word "people" in Psalm 110:3 actually means "troops" - indicating that we are in a spiritual military operation. We live in the "day of His power," a 2,000-year period since the birth of the church, but particularly in these last days. Jesus Christ, as Commander-in-Chief of heaven's forces, is recruiting those who will voluntarily choose to be chosen. Many are called, but few are chosen - and those who are chosen are those who actively choose to respond to God's call.

**2. Love as the Foundation of Discipleship (John 21:15-17)**

The threefold question Jesus posed to Peter - "Do you love Me?" - exposes the heart issue at the core of Christian service. Jesus didn't ask Peter about his theology, his preaching ability, or even his past failures. He asked about love. This reveals that everything in the Christian life must flow from genuine agape love for Christ. The question "Do you love Me more than these?" challenges us to examine whether anything in our lives competes with our devotion to Jesus - whether "these" refers to other people, possessions, positions, or pursuits. True discipleship requires that Jesus Christ holds the supreme place in our affections.

**3. From Failure to Restoration Through Love**

Peter's denial of Christ is juxtaposed with Jesus' patient restoration. Three denials are met with three opportunities to affirm love. This demonstrates that our past failures do not disqualify us from future service when we genuinely love Jesus. The Lord is more interested in the condition of our hearts than the perfection of our performance. Restoration always comes through returning to our first love and re-establishing Jesus as Lord of our lives.

**4. Love Expressed Through Obedience and Service (John 21:15-17)**

With each affirmation of love, Jesus gave Peter a commission: "Feed My lambs," "Tend My sheep," and "Feed My sheep." This pattern reveals that love for Christ is never meant to be merely emotional or sentimental - it must be demonstrated through practical obedience and sacrificial service to God's people. Those who truly love Jesus will care for what He cares about: His church, His sheep, and the advancement of His kingdom. Our love is proven not by our words but by our willingness to serve others in His name.

**5. The Cost of Radical Discipleship (John 21:18-19)**

Jesus didn't hide the cost of following Him. He prophetically told Peter about the kind of death by which he would glorify God. Radical discipleship may require us to lay down our lives, our rights, our comfort, and our preferences. Jesus said, "Follow Me" - not to a place of ease, but to a cross. The call to discipleship is a call to die to self daily and to live wholly for Christ, regardless of the personal cost.

**6. Focus on Your Own Calling (John 21:20-22)**

When Peter asked about John's future, Jesus redirected him: "What is that to you? You follow Me!" This teaches us not to compare our calling with others or to be distracted by what God is doing in someone else's life. Each disciple has a unique path and calling. Our responsibility is singular: to follow Jesus faithfully, wherever He leads, without concerning ourselves with the assignments of others.

### Practical Applications

1. **Examine Your Love:** Regularly ask yourself, "Do I truly love Jesus more than anything or anyone else?" Let this be a heart check, not just a religious exercise.

2. **Choose to Be Chosen:** Recognize that God is calling you to radical discipleship. Make the conscious decision to fully surrender to His lordship and volunteer for His service.

3. **Serve His Sheep:** Demonstrate your love for Christ by caring for His people. Get involved in ministry, mentorship, and meeting the practical and spiritual needs of fellow believers.

4. **Count the Cost:** Understand that following Jesus may cost you everything - relationships, comfort, reputation, or even your life. Make the decision now that He is worth it.

5. **Stay Focused on Your Call:** Don't be distracted by what God is doing with others. Keep your eyes on Jesus and walk faithfully in the path He has set before you.

6. **Be Willing in the Day of His Power:** This is an urgent hour. The Lord is looking for volunteers who will stand up, step forward, and say, "Here I am, send me."

### Key Illustrations and Testimonies

The sermon opened with a historical reference to the United States Marines' recruitment slogan, "A Few Good Men," drawing a parallel to Jesus' call for committed disciples. Just as the Marines sought volunteers willing to serve with excellence and sacrifice, Jesus is seeking those who will voluntarily commit to radical discipleship in this critical hour of history.

## SCRIPTURE-BASED PRAYER POINTS

### 1. Prayer for Supreme Love for Christ
**Focus:** For love for Jesus to exceed all other affections

Heavenly Father, we cry out for hearts that burn with undivided love for Your Son, Jesus Christ. Like Peter, we have failed You, denied You, and placed other things before You. We ask You to restore our first love and to make Jesus the supreme treasure of our hearts. Lord, we declare with Peter, "You know all things; You know that we love You!" Let our love for Christ be greater than our love for comfort, possessions, reputation, or even our own families. Consume us with holy passion for Jesus that compels us to serve You with abandoned devotion.

**Scripture:** "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" (Matthew 6:33)

### 2. Prayer for Willing Hearts in the Day of God's Power
**Focus:** For the church to volunteer as His troops in this critical hour

Lord of Hosts, we recognize that we are living in the day of Your power, and You are calling for willing volunteers to serve in Your army. We respond to Your call and say, "Here we are, send us!" Make us troops who are willing to stand for righteousness, to advance Your kingdom, and to fulfill the Great Commission. Remove every hesitation, fear, and compromise from our hearts. We choose to be chosen. We volunteer to be among the "few good men" who will serve You with excellence and total commitment in this generation.

**Scripture:** "Your people shall be volunteers in the day of Your power" (Psalm 110:3, NKJV)

### 3. Prayer for Faithful Shepherding of God's People
**Focus:** For grace to feed and tend Christ's sheep

Good Shepherd, You have called us not only to love You but to demonstrate that love by caring for Your people. Give us Your heart for the sheep - for the lambs who are young in faith, for the weak who need tender care, and for the mature who need continual feeding on Your Word. Raise up faithful shepherds, teachers, and mentors in our midst who will feed Your flock with truth, protect them from wolves, and lead them to green pastures. Help us to see every opportunity to serve others as an opportunity to express our love for You.

**Scripture:** "Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly" (1 Peter 5:2)

### 4. Prayer for Grace to Embrace the Cost of Discipleship
**Focus:** For courage to follow Christ regardless of the personal cost

Lord Jesus, You never promised us an easy path. You told Your disciples that following You would cost them everything, even their lives. We ask for grace to count the cost and to embrace it willingly. Deliver us from the spirit of comfort and complacency that weakens the church. Give us the spirit of the martyrs who loved not their lives unto death. Whether You call us to literal martyrdom or to daily die to our own desires, give us strength to say, "Not my will, but Yours be done."

**Scripture:** "Then Jesus said to His disciples, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'" (Matthew 16:24)

### 5. Prayer for Restoration from Past Failures
**Focus:** For those burdened by past denials and failures

Merciful Father, we thank You that our past failures do not disqualify us from future service. Just as You restored Peter after his three denials, restore every believer who has fallen, failed, or denied You. Speak words of recommissioning over those who are paralyzed by guilt and shame. Remind us that Your mercies are new every morning and that You specialize in resurrection and restoration. Turn our mourning into dancing and our ashes into beauty as we return to You with our whole hearts.

**Scripture:** "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart - these, O God, You will not despise" (Psalm 51:17)

### 6. Prayer for Undistracted Focus on Our Personal Calling
**Focus:** For grace to follow Jesus without comparing ourselves to others

Faithful Lord, deliver us from the trap of comparison and competition in the body of Christ. When we are tempted to look at what You are doing in someone else's life and ask, "What about them?" remind us of Your words to Peter: "What is that to you? You follow Me!" Help us to run our own race with perseverance, to steward our unique calling with faithfulness, and to celebrate what You are doing in the lives of our brothers and sisters without envy or distraction. Keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

**Scripture:** "Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:1-2)

### 7. Prayer for the Church to Arise as Radical Disciples
**Focus:** For corporate awakening to radical discipleship

God of Revival, we pray for a mighty awakening in Your church. Shake us from spiritual slumber, religious routine, and lukewarm Christianity. Raise up a generation of radical disciples who will turn the world upside down for Jesus Christ. Let Your church be known not for our buildings or programs, but for our extravagant love for Jesus and our sacrificial service to others. Pour out Your Spirit upon us and thrust us into the harvest fields as laborers who are willing to do whatever it takes to see Your kingdom come and Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

**Scripture:** "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest" (Matthew 9:37-38)

**Closing Declaration:**

We declare that we love Jesus Christ more than these - more than comfort, more than approval, more than security, more than life itself. We choose to be chosen. We volunteer to serve as His troops in the day of His power. We will feed His lambs, tend His sheep, and follow Him wherever He leads, no matter the cost. To God be all glory, honor, and praise!

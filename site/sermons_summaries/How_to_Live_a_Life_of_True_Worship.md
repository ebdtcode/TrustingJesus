## Comprehensive Sermon Summary

Rev. Casimir Bilong delivered a powerful and convicting message addressing the fundamental question every believer must answer: "Now that I'm saved, what does the Lord expect of me?" The central thesis of this sermon is profound yet simple: God expects us to live a life of true worship by offering our entire being as a living, holy sacrifice to Him.

The message challenges the shallow, entertainment-focused Christianity that characterizes much of modern church culture. True worship, Rev. Bilong emphasizes, is not limited to Sunday morning services or occasional altar visits. Rather, it is a complete consecration of our body, soul, and spirit to God every single day. Drawing from Romans 12:1, he painted a vivid picture: we are to imagine ourselves lying permanently on God's altar, totally surrendered and available for His use.

The sermon systematically unpacks six key principles for living this life of true worship:

**First**, believers must beware of the world's broken systems. Whether political, economic, or social, the world's structures are fundamentally flawed and cannot provide the answers we seek. We have direct access to the Creator of the Universe through Christ, so why would we anchor our hopes and make major life decisions based on worldly standards that change like shifting sand?

**Second**, we must submit to the process of spiritual transformation. This transformation happens not through microwave-quick formulas, but through daily, sustained meditation on God's Word. As we focus our minds on Scripture in a sustained manner, God gradually changes the way we think, believe, and behave. Through this meditation, God reveals His perfect will to us.

**Third**, we need to properly understand our role within the body of Christ. No believer is better than another. We are all equally important parts of one body, each with unique gifts, talents, and abilities that God has given not for our personal glory but for the edification of the entire body. This calls for humility and honest self-evaluation.

**Fourth**, we must assume our responsibilities within the body faithfully. Whether our gift is prophecy, teaching, serving, giving, leadership, or showing kindness, we are called to exercise it diligently. When we sit on our gifts, we hurt ourselves and damage the body. With dozens of ministries available in the local church, no one can claim they cannot find a place to serve.

**Fifth**, believers must build genuine relationships of love within the body of Christ. This means no plastic smiles or pretend love. We are called to really love one another with genuine affection, to be ready to help when God's people are in need, and to practice hospitality eagerly. When we ask "How are you?" it should reflect a genuine intention to know and help if possible.

**Sixth**, we must reflect Christ outside the body. As Christ's ambassadors in the world, we are called to bless those who persecute us, show empathy to unbelievers (remembering they cannot help their behavior without Christ), and live in harmony with all people. We must never be too proud to learn from anyone, whether believer or unbeliever, adult or child.

The sermon concludes with a sobering challenge: Is your life totally surrendered to God? Is your life totally consecrated to Him? This is not a rhetorical question but a call to serious self-examination. Rev. Bilong urged the congregation not to take lightly what God has done for them, but to live with the seriousness and dedication that befits those who have been rescued from darkness and brought into God's marvelous light.

The ultimate vision is that by living these six principles, believers will not only grow in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness, but will also effectively reach lost souls for Christ, working toward the church's vision of "a world where no one lives or dies without Christ."

**Prayer:** Father, we come before You asking for the gift of humility. Help us not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought.

Remove every trace of spiritual lethargy and complacency. Help us to work hard in whatever ministry You have assigned to us. Whether we are visible or behind the scenes, may we serve with excellence and joy. Remind us that our work is not for human recognition but for Your glory. May we serve You with the same dedication and enthusiasm that marked the early church. Give us supernatural energy and stamina to fulfill all that You have called us to do.

### 10. Prayer for Vision to Win Lost Souls for Christ
**Focus:** That our worship through transformed lives would lead others to salvation

**Prayer:** Lord, we recognize that living a life of true worship is not just about our personal holiness but about Your mission to seek and save the lost. As we refuse to follow the patterns of this world, meditate on Your Word, use our gifts faithfully, build genuine relationships within the body, and reflect Your love to the world, we pray that multiple lost souls would be won to Christ. Open our eyes to see the harvest fields around us. Give us divine appointments with those who need to hear the gospel. May our transformed lives be such a powerful testimony that people cannot help but ask about the hope within us. Use us as instruments to reach those who are living and dying without Christ. Align our hearts with Your church's vision: "a world where no one lives or dies without Christ." May everything we do - every act of service, every word of encouragement, every demonstration of love - point people to You.

### 11. Prayer for Right Priorities and God's Perfect Will
**Focus:** That we would know and walk in God's perfect will for our lives

**Prayer:** Father, we come before You asking for clarity about Your will for our lives. We confess that we have often set our priorities based on worldly values - chasing money, status, comfort, and temporary pleasures. We recognize that physical pleasures last only moments but Your purposes are eternal. Help us to align our priorities with Your kingdom values. As we meditate on Your Word day and night, reveal to us Your good, pleasing, and perfect will. Give us wisdom for major life-altering decisions - choices about careers, relationships, finances, and ministry. May we never make these decisions based on the broken systems of this world but always seek Your face first. Help us to remember that we have Your direct contact and can come boldly into Your throne of grace to receive guidance. Lead us in paths of righteousness for Your name's sake.

**Scripture:** Romans 12:2 - "Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect."

### 12. Prayer for the Dwelling of the Holy Spirit and Holiness
**Focus:** That we would honor the Holy Spirit's presence in our lives and walk in holiness

**Prayer:** Holy Spirit, we thank You that You have made Your dwelling place in our bodies. We honor You and worship You as God. Help us to live in constant awareness of Your presence within us. Remind us daily that our bodies are Your temple and must be kept holy. Convict us of any sin, compromise, or uncleanness that grieves You. We ask that You would sanctify us and set us apart completely for God's use. Continue the process of making us holy throughout our lives. May the sacrifice we offer to God be truly holy because You dwell in us. Empower us to live lives worthy of Your indwelling presence. Help us to make choices that honor You in our thoughts, words, and actions. Thank You that by Your presence, we are made acceptable to God and can offer ourselves as living and holy sacrifices.

**Scripture:** Romans 12:1 - "Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable." (Context: We are holy because the Holy Spirit dwells in us)

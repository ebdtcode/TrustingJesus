## SERMON SUMMARY

Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivers a transformative message on "Living the Higher Life" from Colossians 3:1-10, challenging believers to embrace their true spiritual identity in Christ and live from their heavenly position rather than earthly circumstances.

The central theme of this sermon is that believers are called to live a life consistent with their spiritual identity in Christ - a life characterized by three essential qualities: **faith in Christ, love for one another, and everlasting hope**. These three marks of spiritual maturity were what the Apostle Paul celebrated in the Colossian believers and what God looks for in us today. When these qualities are active and growing in our lives, we are experiencing true spiritual growth that pleases the Father.

Bishop Johnson powerfully illustrates this higher life using the analogy of an airplane flight. Just as flying above the clouds at 10,000 feet provides smooth sailing above the turbulent weather below, living from our spiritual position in Christ enables us to respond to life's storms from a place of peace, power, and purpose. The weather below didn't change - the altitude did. Similarly, our circumstances may not change, but our perspective and response can be transformed when we live from our position "in Christ."

The sermon emphasizes a critical truth: **Christ is our singular, all-sufficient Source**. Based on Colossians 2:9-10, the Bishop declares that in Christ "dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily," and that we are "complete in Him." Everything God is, Jesus is. Everything God has, Jesus has. Everything God can do, Jesus can do. Since we are joined to Christ, we lack nothing. The key to experiencing the higher life is found in Colossians 2:19 - to "hold fast to the Head," from whom the entire body receives nourishment and grows with the increase that is from God.

Using the powerful illustration of an eagle raised among chickens, Bishop Johnson challenges believers to stop "eating worms from the dust" and embrace their true identity. Like the eagle that discovered it had wings to soar, Christians must realize they were not designed for earthly living but for heavenly living - not chickens but eagles. We are called to live above the flesh, above sin, and above this world system.

The Bishop warns of Satan's primary strategy: to disconnect our minds from their singular focus on Christ as our Source. While Satan cannot undo what God has done in salvation, he can render us powerless by getting us to look elsewhere for what we already have in Christ. This happens through false philosophies, mystical teachings, legalistic practices, worship of angels, false humility, and any teaching that suggests Christ alone is not sufficient. The moment we lose focus on Christ, we become like a light bulb disconnected from its power source - still a light bulb, but no longer shining.

Practically, living the higher life requires three conscious decisions: First, **seek the things which are above** because that is where we spiritually live and where the best things are located. Second, **set our minds on things above** through meditation on God's Word and learning to "change the channel" of our thoughts using our mouth as a remote control. When negative or earthly thoughts bombard our minds, we can click - change the channel - and speak the truth of who we are in Christ. Third, **mortify (put to death) the deeds of the flesh** - not by crucifying ourselves (the old man is already dead), but by discarding the old furniture left behind by the previous occupant and bringing in new things from Christ.

This higher life - which Jesus called the abundant life - is not just better spiritually; it's better in every dimension of life. It produces peace in turbulence, power in weakness, and purpose in confusion. We were born for this life, equipped for this life, and positioned for this life through our union with Christ. Our spiritual address is "in Christ," seated with Him in heavenly places, and we must live from where we are, not from where we were.

## PRAYER POINTS

### 1. For Embracing Our Identity in Christ
**Prayer Focus:** That we would fully embrace and walk in our true spiritual identity as new creations in Christ, no longer living as "chickens eating worms from the dust" but as eagles designed to soar.

**Scripture Foundation:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new" (2 Corinthians 5:17); "For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3)

**Prayer:** Father, I thank You that I am a new creation in Christ Jesus. Help me to fully embrace my true identity - that I am no longer who I once was, but I am now in Christ, hidden in You. Remove every mindset that keeps me thinking like a "mere sinner" or "mere man." Open my eyes to see that I was born for the higher life, equipped to live above this world system. Let me stop eating the worms of earthly thinking and spread my wings to soar in the reality of who You have made me to be. I declare that my old nature died with Christ on the cross, and I now live the resurrected life in Him. Let this truth transform how I see myself, how I make decisions, and how I respond to life's challenges.

### 2. For Faith in Christ, Love for One Another, and Everlasting Hope
**Prayer Focus:** That the three essential marks of spiritual maturity - faith in Christ, love for one another, and everlasting hope - would be active and growing in our lives.

**Scripture Foundation:** "We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints; because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven" (Colossians 1:3-5)

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, I pray for the growth of genuine faith in Christ - not faith in myself, not faith in circumstances, not even faith in faith, but faith in Christ alone. Increase my confidence in who He is and what He has accomplished. I pray for a supernatural love for my brothers and sisters in Christ - a love that goes beyond preference, beyond convenience, beyond offense. Let me truly walk in love toward one another as You have commanded. And Lord, establish in me an everlasting hope that keeps me steadfast and anchored no matter what life brings. When trials come, when storms rage, when circumstances are difficult, let my hope in You keep me secure and faithful. Let these three evidences of spiritual growth be visible and increasing in my life, bringing pleasure to Your heart.

### 3. For Holding Fast to Christ as Our Singular Source
**Prayer Focus:** That we would maintain unwavering focus on Christ alone as our all-sufficient Source for everything we need, resisting every distraction and false teaching that would disconnect us from Him.

**Scripture Foundation:** "And not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God" (Colossians 2:19); "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him" (Colossians 2:9-10)

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, I hold fast to You as the Head, the Source of everything I need for life and godliness. I declare that in You dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily - everything God is, You are; everything God has, You have; everything God can do, You can do. And because I am in You, I am complete. I lack nothing. Forgive me for the times I have looked elsewhere for what I already have in You. Protect my mind from philosophies, false teachings, mystical revelations, legalistic practices, or any teaching that suggests You alone are not sufficient. Let no one cheat me of the reward and fullness of life available in Christ Jesus. I refuse to be disconnected from You, my power Source. Keep my faith firmly anchored in Christ as my singular, all-sufficient Source for increase in every area of my life.

### 4. For Setting Our Minds on Things Above
**Prayer Focus:** That we would develop the spiritual discipline of consistently setting our minds on things above, learning to "change the channel" when the enemy bombards us with earthly, negative, or destructive thoughts.

**Scripture Foundation:** "If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth" (Colossians 3:1-2)

**Prayer:** Father, I have been raised with Christ and seated with Him in heavenly places. My spiritual address is "in Christ," where all of God's resources are available to me. Teach me to consistently seek the things which are above and to set my mind on heavenly realities rather than earthly circumstances. Give me the wisdom and discipline to meditate on Your Word so that when the enemy pumps disturbing thoughts into my mind, I have Your truth already in me. Help me to use my mouth as a "remote control" - to speak Your Word and declare Your truth when negative thoughts come. When thoughts of fear, worry, condemnation, or defeat arise, remind me to "click" and change the channel, declaring: "I am in Christ. My life is complete in Him. Everything He is, I am. Everything He has, I have. I'm living from above." Let meditation on Your Word and the practice of speaking truth become my consistent lifestyle.

### 5. For Putting Off the Old and Putting On the New
**Prayer Focus:** That we would actively mortify (put to death) the deeds of the flesh that belonged to our old nature and put on the character and nature of Christ.

**Scripture Foundation:** "Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry... But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him" (Colossians 3:5, 8-10)

**Prayer:** Lord, I thank You that my old man - the person I was before Christ - was crucified with Jesus on the cross. That old nature is dead and no longer lives. But that old man left behind furniture that doesn't belong to the new man I am in Christ. Give me the courage and strength to discard everything that is incompatible with my new identity: fornication, adultery, lying, anger, jealousy, covetousness, idolatry, gossip, evil speaking, and every work of the flesh. These things are not who I am - I am an eagle, not a chicken. As I remove the old furniture, help me to bring in the new things from Christ - the fruit of the Spirit, the character of Christ, the mind of Christ. Clean out my house completely and fill it with the things which are above. I declare that I and these old patterns are no longer in agreement. I choose to live in alignment with my new nature in Christ Jesus.

### 6. For Protection Through Prayer and Spiritual Warfare
**Prayer Focus:** That the church would commit to praying for one another, protecting each other from the enemy's strategy to disconnect our minds from Christ through philosophies, false teachings, and distractions.

**Scripture Foundation:** "Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding fast to the Head" (Colossians 2:18-19)

**Prayer:** Father, just as Paul prayed continually for believers who were growing spiritually, I pray for my brothers and sisters in Christ. Protect us from the enemy's schemes to distract us from Jesus through false teachings, mystical experiences, legalistic practices, new age philosophies, and traditions of men. In this world where we are bombarded through the internet, television, schools, and culture with ideas that are not according to Christ, help us to recognize and reject every lie. Guard our minds from spiritual warfare designed to control our thoughts and take our focus off Jesus. When the enemy tries to present alternatives to Christ or disguise false teaching as though it were from You, give us discernment to recognize it and reject it. Let us encourage one another to stay focused on Christ alone. Raise up intercessors who will stand in the gap, praying that nothing the enemy tries will succeed in disconnecting us from our Source. Let our church be a people who hold fast to Jesus as our Head.

### 7. For Living the Abundant Life with Peace, Power, and Purpose
**Prayer Focus:** That we would consistently experience and walk in the abundant, higher life that Jesus came to give us - a life characterized by peace in turbulence, power in weakness, and purpose in every circumstance.

**Scripture Foundation:** "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly" (John 10:10); "When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory" (Colossians 3:4)

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, You came to give me abundant life - the higher life that is lived from above. I refuse to live beneath my privileges in Christ. I was designed for the higher life, and higher is better. Just as it's smoother above the turbulence, help me to respond to life's storms from my position in Christ rather than from my circumstances. In the midst of turbulence in this world, let me experience Your perfect peace that passes understanding. In moments of weakness, let Your strength be made perfect in me. In times of confusion, let me walk in the clarity of purpose that comes from knowing who I am and whose I am. I declare that I am living the higher life - the abundant life - characterized by faith in Christ, love for one another, and everlasting hope. This produces in me a life of peace, power, and purpose that brings glory to Your name. Let others see this higher life in me and be drawn to Christ. I am in this world but not of this world. I am seated with Christ in heavenly places, and I choose to live from there.

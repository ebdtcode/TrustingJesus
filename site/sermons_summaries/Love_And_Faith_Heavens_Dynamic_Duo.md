# Love And Faith: Heaven's Dynamic Duo

**Speaker:** Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson
**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Theme:** Year of God's Unfailing Love

---

## Sermon Summary

Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson launched 2026 as the "Year of God's Unfailing Love," declaring that God's love is the strongest, most powerful force in the universe—a love that never fails, never changes, and never runs out. Drawing from Romans 8:31-39 and 1 Corinthians 13, he emphasized that nothing can separate us from God's love, which has already provided everything we need through Christ. This divine love is not passive but active, constantly working on our behalf, and it forms the foundation of every victory and blessing we will experience this year.

The core revelation of this message is that love and faith function as heaven's "dynamic duo"—they are inseparable partners in God's redemptive plan. While God's love has already provided everything (salvation, healing, provision, deliverance), faith is the God-given mechanism by which we receive and release that provision. Faith is not striving or earning; rather, it is a rest in what love has already accomplished. Bishop Johnson explained that faith operates through two primary channels: walking in love ourselves (giving, serving, sacrificing for others) and speaking with our mouths—declaring and vocalizing our agreement with God's Word. He challenged the congregation that silent Christianity is weak Christianity, and when believers vocalize their faith corporately, they create a legal spiritual environment that allows heaven to move freely on earth.

The Bishop concluded with a prophetic call to action for 2026: believers must learn to operate in both dimensions of this dynamic duo. We must rest in the confidence that God's love has already won every battle, while simultaneously activating our faith through loving actions and bold declarations. This year will not be about struggling but about receiving what love has provided and releasing it through faith. As we walk in love toward others and speak in agreement with God's Word, we position ourselves to experience the fullness of God's unfailing love in every area of our lives—family, finances, health, relationships, and spiritual breakthrough.

- **God's love is the strongest force in the universe** - Nothing can separate us from it (Romans 8:38-39); it surpasses all understanding and is the foundation of every blessing

- **Love and Faith are inseparable partners** - Love provides everything; faith receives and releases what love has already accomplished (the "dynamic duo")

- **Faith is not striving but resting** - Faith brings us into alignment with what God's love has already done; it is trust and confidence in His completed work

- **Faith is activated through walking in love** - When we love others through giving, serving, and sacrificing, we activate the flow of God's provision in our own lives (James 2:14-26)

- **Vocal declaration is essential to faith** - "We believe, therefore we speak" (2 Corinthians 4:13); faith must be spoken and declared, not merely believed internally

- **Silent Christianity is weak Christianity** - A silent believer and a silent church lack power; vocal agreement with God's Word creates spiritual authority

- **Corporate vocal prayer creates legal spiritual environments** - When the church speaks in agreement, heaven gains legal authority to move freely on earth and manifest God's will

## Scripture-Based Prayer Points

### 1. Prayer for Deeper Revelation of God's Unfailing Love
**Prayer:** Father, we pray for a fresh, deep revelation of Your unfailing love in 2026. Open the eyes of our hearts to comprehend with all the saints what is the width, length, depth, and height of Your love that surpasses knowledge. Let us be rooted and grounded in this love so firmly that no circumstance, trial, or attack can ever make us doubt Your goodness toward us. Fill us to all the fullness of God through this revelation.

**Scripture:** Ephesians 3:17-19 - "That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."

### 2. Prayer for Faith That Rests in God's Finished Work
**Prayer:** Lord, we pray for supernatural faith that rests confidently in what Your love has already accomplished through the cross. Remove every trace of striving, anxiety, and self-effort from our hearts. Help us to cease from our own works and enter into Your rest. Let our faith be childlike trust that declares, "It is finished," over every situation we face. Teach us that faith is not about earning Your love but receiving what love has already provided.

**Scripture:** Hebrews 4:10 - "For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His." | Romans 10:17 - "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."

---

### 3. Prayer for Love Activated Through Action
**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, stir up practical, sacrificial love in our hearts toward others. Help us to understand that faith without works is dead, and that as we walk in love—giving, serving, and laying down our lives—we activate Your supernatural provision in our own lives. Make us conduits of Your love, freely giving as we have freely received. Let our faith work through love this year, demonstrating the reality of Christ in us.

**Scripture:** Galatians 5:6 - "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love." | James 2:17 - "Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."

---

### 4. Prayer for Bold Vocal Declaration and Agreement
**Prayer:** Father, we break off every spirit of silence, timidity, and fear from Your church. Release the spirit of faith upon us so that we believe and therefore speak. Teach us to use our mouths as weapons of warfare, declaring Your Word with boldness and authority. Let our homes, churches, and lives be filled with declarations of Your goodness, power, and promises. Create in us a culture of vocal agreement that establishes Your Kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 4:13 - "And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, 'I believed and therefore I spoke,' we also believe and therefore speak." | Romans 10:8-10 - "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart... For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

### 5. Prayer for Nothing to Separate Us from God's Love
**Prayer:** Lord, we stand on the unshakable promise that nothing—absolutely nothing—can separate us from Your love in Christ Jesus. We declare that tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, danger, financial lack, sickness, or any spiritual force cannot break our connection to Your love. Neither death nor life, angels nor demons, present troubles nor future fears, height nor depth, nor any created thing can separate us from the love of God. We rest in this eternal security and victory.

**Scripture:** Romans 8:38-39 - "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

---

### 6. Prayer for Corporate Unity and Vocal Authority in the Church
**Prayer:** Father, unite Your church in powerful agreement as we enter this Year of God's Unfailing Love. Let us come together in one voice, one heart, and one spirit, declaring Your Word and Your will over our families, our city, our nation, and the nations of the earth. Break down every wall of division, silence, and independence. Release corporate anointing when we gather and speak in agreement, creating legal spiritual environments where heaven moves freely and miracles manifest. Let the world know that You have sent Jesus by the love and unity we demonstrate.

**Scripture:** Matthew 18:19-20 - "Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them." | 1 Corinthians 1:10 - "Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."

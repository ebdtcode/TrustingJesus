## Sermon Summary

This powerful message reveals the profound connection between God's unfailing love, the creative power of words, and the authority believers possess through faith-filled speech. Bishop Johnson emphasizes that while God's love is almighty and capable of doing anything, we must actively agree with His purposes through both our words and our works. The sermon traces the divine principle of creative speech from Genesis, where God spoke the universe into existence, to the New Testament examples of faith demonstrated through declaration.

The message highlights two compelling biblical accounts: the woman with the issue of blood who spoke her faith ("If I just touch His garment, I will be made whole") and the Roman centurion who understood authority and declared that Jesus only needed to "speak the word" for healing to occur. These narratives illustrate that faith is not passive belief but active declaration aligned with God's character and promises.

A central theological truth emerges: God created humanity in His image and likeness, endowing us with the same creative capacity through speech. When Adam named the animals in the Garden of Eden, he wasn't merely cataloging creation—he was exercising dominion and authority through the power of words. This divine design means our words are not simply meant to describe our current reality but to create and shape our future reality in alignment with God's will.

The sermon delivers a sobering warning from Proverbs 18:21: "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit." Our words carry tremendous spiritual weight—they can release faith, hope, and love, or they can unleash fear, hopelessness, and hatred. James' epistle provides crucial instruction on bridling the tongue, warning that religious activity becomes worthless when we fail to control our speech. The tongue, though small, acts like a rudder that steers the entire direction of our lives.

The message culminates with a clarion call to choose life by choosing words of life. Believers are challenged to align their speech with God's Word and His character, understanding that every word spoken is a seed planted that will eventually bear fruit. This is not positive thinking or self-help philosophy—it is biblical truth that our words, when saturated with faith and aligned with Scripture, release divine authority and creative power into our circumstances.

## Key Points

1. **God's Love Requires Our Agreement** - God's almighty love can accomplish anything, but we must actively agree with His purposes through our words and works, not passive acceptance.

2. **Words Release Divine Authority** - God created the entire universe by speaking (Genesis 1:3). Words are not mere sounds but carriers of creative power and spiritual authority.

3. **Faith Must Be Spoken** - The woman with the issue of blood and the Roman centurion both demonstrated that genuine faith expresses itself through declaration and confession.

4. **Created in God's Image for Dominion** - Humanity was created in God's image and given dominion, which is exercised primarily through the power of speech, mirroring how God operates.

5. **Adam's Naming Authority** - When Adam named the animals, he was exercising the God-given authority to define and govern creation through words.

6. **Words Create, Not Just Describe** - Our words are designed to create our reality in alignment with God's will, not merely to describe our current circumstances.

7. **Life and Death Power** - Proverbs 18:21 declares that death and life are in the power of the tongue; we will eat the fruit of whatever we consistently speak.

8. **Words Carry Spiritual Content** - Every word carries either faith, hope, and love OR fear, hopelessness, and hatred—there is no neutral speech.

9. **Bridle the Tongue for True Religion** - James warns that religious activity without controlling our speech is worthless; tongue-control is essential to authentic faith (James 1:26).

10. **The Tongue as a Rudder** - Though small, the tongue steers the entire direction of our lives, just as a small rudder directs a large ship (James 3:2-6).

11. **Speak to Mountains** - Jesus taught that we should speak directly to our mountains (problems) with faith-filled words, commanding them to move (Mark 11:23).

12. **Choose Life Through Words** - Deuteronomy 30:19 calls us to choose life; this choice is made daily through the words we speak over ourselves, our families, and our circumstances.

## Prayer Points

### 1. For a Transformed Tongue Aligned with God's Word
**Focus:** Holy Spirit empowerment to speak life consistently

**Prayer:** Father, I thank You that You have given me the same creative power through words that You demonstrated in Genesis. I ask for a complete transformation of my speech patterns. Help me to bridle my tongue and speak only words that align with Your Word and character. Let every word that proceeds from my mouth be seasoned with grace, faith, hope, and love. Remove from me all complaining, murmuring, cursing, and negative declarations that contradict Your promises.

**Scripture:** *"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my strength and my Redeemer" (Psalm 19:14)*

---

### 2. For Faith-Filled Declarations Over Impossible Situations
**Focus:** Speaking to our mountains with authority

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, You taught that if we speak to the mountain with faith and do not doubt in our hearts, whatever we say will come to pass. I declare Your Word over every impossible situation in my life. I speak to the mountain of [financial lack/sickness/broken relationships/addiction] and command it to be removed and cast into the sea. I will not merely pray about my problems; I will speak directly to them with the authority You have given me through Your name.

**Scripture:** *"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says" (Mark 11:23)*

---

### 3. For the Church to Walk in Dominion Authority
**Focus:** Intercession for believers to understand and operate in their God-given authority

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, I pray for Your Church across the earth. Open our eyes to understand that we were created in Your image and given dominion through the power of speech. Forgive us for speaking defeat when You have declared victory, for speaking sickness when You have provided healing, for speaking poverty when You have promised abundance. Raise up a generation of believers who understand the authority of their words and who speak Your purposes into existence with boldness and faith.

**Scripture:** *"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion...'" (Genesis 1:26)*

---

### 4. For Breaking the Cycle of Negative Speech Patterns
**Focus:** Repentance and renewal of the mind regarding speech

**Prayer:** Father God, I confess that I have often used my tongue to curse rather than bless, to tear down rather than build up, to speak fear rather than faith. I repent of every word spoken in anger, bitterness, gossip, slander, and unbelief. Wash me clean by the blood of Jesus and renew my mind according to Your Word. Break every generational curse of negative speech in my family line. From this day forward, I choose to use my words to create life, hope, healing, and blessing.

**Scripture:** *"Not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. For 'He who would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit'" (1 Peter 3:9-10)*

---

### 5. For Wisdom and Self-Control in Communication
**Focus:** The bridling of the tongue for spiritual maturity

**Prayer:** Lord, Your Word declares that if anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body. I acknowledge that the tongue is a small member but capable of great destruction when unbridled. Grant me supernatural wisdom and self-control over my speech. Let my words be few, but weighty with truth and grace. Help me to be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. May my religious devotion be proven genuine by my controlled and purposeful speech.

**Scripture:** *"If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is useless" (James 1:26)*

---

### 6. For Speaking Salvation and Righteousness
**Focus:** Confession of faith for personal salvation and witnessing

**Prayer:** Father, I thank You that the word of faith is near me, in my mouth and in my heart. I boldly confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in my heart that You raised Him from the dead. I am saved, justified, and made righteous through this confession of faith. Give me boldness to speak this same confession to others, that they too may be saved. Let my life and my lips proclaim the excellencies of Him who called me out of darkness into His marvelous light.

**Scripture:** *"But what does it say? 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart' (that is, the word of faith which we preach): that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:8-9)*

---

### 7. For Daily Choice of Life-Giving Words
**Focus:** Intentional decision to speak blessing over curse

**Prayer:** Almighty God, You have set before me life and death, blessing and cursing, and You have commanded me to choose life. I make a deliberate, conscious choice today to speak words of life over myself, my family, my church, my community, and my nation. I refuse to partner with the voice of the enemy who comes to kill, steal, and destroy. Instead, I align my words with Your Word, which brings abundant life. Let every word I speak today plant seeds of righteousness, peace, joy, healing, and prosperity.

**Scripture:** *"I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live" (Deuteronomy 30:19)*

---

### 8. For Agreement Between Words and Works
**Focus:** Integrity and consistency between confession and action

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, Your sermon reminds us that we must agree with Your love not only through our words but also through our works. Deliver me from being a hearer only and not a doer of the Word. Let my actions confirm my confessions and my confessions inspire my actions. May there be no contradiction between what I say I believe and how I live my life. Let my faith be demonstrated through both my declarations and my deeds, bringing glory to Your name.

**Scripture:** *"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves" (James 1:22)*

---

### 9. For Understanding the Framing Power of Words
**Focus:** Revelation of how God's Word frames our world

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, by faith I understand that the worlds were framed by Your Word, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible. Teach me to operate in this same principle—to speak Your invisible promises until they become visible realities in my life. Help me to see with eyes of faith and speak with a tongue of faith, calling those things which do not exist as though they did, just as You do. Let my words frame my future according to Your divine purpose and plan.

**Scripture:** *"By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible" (Hebrews 11:3)*

---

### 10. For Eating the Good Fruit of Righteous Speech
**Focus:** Thanksgiving for the harvest of life-giving words

**Prayer:** Father, Your Word promises that those who love the tongue will eat its fruit—whether good or evil. I choose to love words of life, and I thank You in advance for the abundant harvest of blessing that will come from consistently speaking Your truth. I will eat the fruit of righteousness, peace, joy, health, favor, and breakthrough because I have planted seeds of faith-filled words. Thank You that my latter days will be greater than my former days because I have learned to steward the power of my tongue for Your glory.

**Scripture:** *"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit" (Proverbs 18:21)*

---

## Closing Declaration

*"I decree and declare that from this day forward, my tongue shall be an instrument of righteousness, speaking life, faith, hope, and love. I will bridle my tongue and speak only those things that align with God's Word and character. I choose life through my words, and I will eat the good fruit of my faith-filled declarations. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen!"*

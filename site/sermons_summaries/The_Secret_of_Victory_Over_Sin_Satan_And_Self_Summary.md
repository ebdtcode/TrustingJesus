## Main Theme

The secret to victory over sin, Satan, and self is not found in human willpower or striving, but in understanding and believing the spiritual reality of our identification and union with Christ. Victory is not something we fight for, but something we let happen by believing what God has already accomplished through Christ's death and resurrection.

## Central Message

Bishop Johnson challenges the common Christian struggle: the cycle of sin, guilt, repentance, and trying harder, only to sin again. He reveals that this frustrating cycle exists because of either ignorance or unbelief concerning our spiritual position in Christ. The Christian life is less about striving and more about "letting and not letting" - letting Christ's victory work itself out in our lives while refusing to let sin reign.

## Major Theological Concepts

### 1. Identification and Union with Christ

The cornerstone doctrine of this message is that believers are not just metaphorically connected to Christ, but are actually, vitally, spiritually united with Him. This is not positive thinking or mere symbolism - it is spiritual reality. When the Bible says we are "in Christ," it means we are genuinely joined to Him in such a way that His story becomes our story.

**Key Illustration**: Like a handkerchief placed inside a book - wherever the book goes, the handkerchief goes. Because we are in Christ, everywhere He went, we went:
- When Jesus died on the cross, we died with Him
- When Jesus was buried, we were buried with Him
- When Jesus rose from the dead, we rose with Him
- When Jesus defeated sin, Satan, and death, we defeated them in Him
- When Jesus ascended and was seated in heavenly places, we were seated with Him

### 2. The Umbilical Cord Illustration

Bishop Johnson uses the profound analogy of a baby in the womb connected to its mother through the umbilical cord. The baby cannot breathe on its own, yet it receives oxygen because the mother breathes for the baby. The mother also exhales the baby's waste (carbon dioxide). The baby simply lets the mother sustain its life.

Similarly, sin cut the spiritual umbilical cord that connected humanity to God, leaving us dead in sin and separated from life. At the cross, God performed "spiritual surgery" - He opened Jesus up, restored the broken umbilical cord, placed us inside Jesus, and sealed us there with the Holy Spirit. Now Christ Himself, by the Spirit of God, is breathing for us spiritually. We live by the power of His life in us.

### 3. The Problem: Death, Not Just Badness

The fundamental issue with sinners is not that they are bad people, but that they are dead people. And the only thing that can help a dead person is life. God's entire plan of salvation was designed to give us life. Jesus said, "I have come that you may have life, and have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). Nicodemus needed to be born again - he needed life.

### 4. You Are Already Dead to Sin

Many believers misunderstand Scripture and think they must "die to sin" daily. However, the Bible never commands believers to die to sin. Instead, it declares: **"You ARE dead to sin"** (Romans 6:2). This is already accomplished. The battle is won. Trying to die to something you're already dead to reveals either ignorance or unbelief, and this opens the door for the enemy to continue exercising power in your life.

The Apostle Paul's statement "I die daily" (1 Corinthians 15:31) was not about dying to sin, but about facing daily persecution and physical danger for the sake of the gospel.

### 5. Christianity: Participation, Not Imitation

Christianity is not about imitating Christ's example through human effort. It is participation in the very life of Christ Himself. Like placing a tea bag in water transforms the water into tea, God has placed Christ in us and us in Christ so that we become like Jesus. We are "an aroma of Christ" because He is in us and we are in Him.

## The Four Steps to Walking in Victory

Based on Romans 6:11-13, Bishop Johnson outlines four practical steps:

### Step 1: KNOW

**"Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him"** (Romans 6:6)

You cannot walk in victory until you KNOW you already have it. Satan's primary strategy is to keep believers ignorant of the victory Christ has won. Knowledge comes from:
- Spending time in God's Word
- Listening to sound teaching repeatedly
- Writing down key truths
- Meditating on Scripture
- Renewing your mind

The first step to victory is knowing:
- You have been crucified with Christ
- You are dead to sin
- You are alive to God

### Step 2: RECKON (Believe It)

**"Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord"** (Romans 6:11)

"Reckon" is an accounting term - it doesn't mean pretend, but rather "count it as fact." It means:
- Factor it into your thinking
- Count on it as unchangeable truth
- Believe what God says despite your feelings

Feelings can lie. You can feel like someone loves you when they don't. You can feel alive to sin when God says you're dead to it. Don't put your faith in feelings - put your faith in the Word of God who cannot lie.

**Powerful Analogy**: When someone is "dead to you," you have no interest in them, don't respond to their messages, walk past them as if they don't exist. That's how believers should be toward sin - dead to it indeed. Sin and I have nothing in common. I have no appetite for sin because the real me (my spirit) is born of Christ and has no desire for sin.

### Step 3: LET NOT (Refuse Sin's Reign)

**"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts"** (Romans 6:12)

The only way sin can rule over a believer is if the believer LETS it. You must make the decision: "I will not let sin reign in my life."

This is not fighting against sin through willpower, but resisting sin by believing the truth about who you are. "We fight the good fight of faith" - the battle is believing. When temptation comes:
- Say "NO" out loud (faith works when you believe in your heart and speak with your mouth)
- Declare: "I'm dead to sin, I'm alive to God"
- Declare: "Christ is my life, I'm one with Him"
- Declare: "The life of Christ in me empowers me to say no to sin"

Sexual sin, for example, requires planning and deliberate choices. At the first thought, resist by declaring your identity in Christ.

### Step 4: PRESENT (Offer Yourself to God)

**"Do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God"** (Romans 6:13)

Daily prayer practice:
- "Lord, this day I present my body to You to be an instrument for righteousness"
- "I let You live Your life through me today, Christ"
- "Bear Your fruit in me and through me, in Jesus' name"

You let your members (body parts, faculties) become instruments of righteousness by presenting your body to God as someone who is alive from the dead.

## Conclusion

The sermon ends with a powerful altar call - not to come forward, but to commit to reviewing this message repeatedly until it transforms from information to revelation. The charge is clear:

**"From now on, don't fight for victory over sin, over Satan or over self. From now on, stand in the victory that Christ has won and let that victory manifest in your life by believing it, speaking it, declaring it, and renewing your mind with it. If you do that, it will manifest in your life."**

The final declaration believers are to make:

**"I am crucified with Christ. I am dead to sin. I am alive to God. I have His life, His nature, and His ability working in me all the time. He's breathing in for me. He's exhaling out for me. And I am growing, maturing, being transformed into a perfect man, conformed to the image of Jesus. Thank you Lord. This is my reality. In Jesus' name."**

*This sermon provides life-transforming truth about the believer's identity and position in Christ. It shifts the paradigm from struggling to win victory through human effort, to resting in and letting the already-won victory of Christ manifest through faith and believing God's Word.*

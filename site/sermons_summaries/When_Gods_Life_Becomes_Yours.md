## Sermon Summary

In this fourth installment of the "God's Unfailing Love" series, Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson addresses one of the most foundational yet often misunderstood truths of the Christian faith: the doctrine of eternal life (Zoe). Many believers experience a frustrating gap between how they live and how they know they should live—particularly in the area of loving others as Christ loves them. We hear commands like "love your enemies" and "forgive one another" but struggle to obey them, leading to condemnation, guilt, and a sense of failure. The root problem, Bishop Johnson explains, is that we often hear the command to love without understanding why we can and how it becomes possible.

The revelation that transforms everything is this: the capacity to love as God loves comes not from human effort but from the gift of eternal life that every believer received at salvation. This eternal life is not merely a future promise of heaven—it is a present reality, the very life of Christ Himself dwelling in and energizing our spirits right now. Just as biological life (Bios) is the energy source that enables our physical bodies to function, eternal life (Zoe) is the power source that enables our spirits to function as God designed them—to love, to believe, to obey, and to live as Christ lived.

Bishop Johnson makes a critical distinction: eternal life is not God improving our human nature or empowering us to lead our own lives better. God does not do "fixer uppers" with our old nature. Instead, He completely replaces our condemned, self-centered life with His own divine life. Christianity is not about following religious rules through human strength—that would make it no different from any other religion. Rather, Christianity is participating in the very life of God within our spirits. When we received Jesus as Lord and Savior, we didn't just get fire insurance for eternity; we received the life of the Son of God Himself as our own. "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).

This truth has staggering implications. The same eternal life that empowered Jesus to love perfectly, obey fully, and overcome death is now the fuel energizing our spirits. The love we are called to walk in is not manufactured by our willpower—it is the natural expression of the eternal life already dwelling within us. The capacity is there. The love is there. The power is there. Our challenge is not to create love but to receive revelation of what we already possess and learn to rely on it consistently. As Jesus said, "As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Abide in My love" (John 15:9). When we become secure in knowing how deeply we are loved by Christ—loved as much as the Father loves Him—we become free to love others without defensiveness, self-protection, or fear. We can walk in the higher law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which overcomes the law of sin and death operating in our flesh.

Bishop Johnson concludes by emphasizing that eternal life is God's answer to every attack of the enemy. Satan comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but Jesus came to give us life—eternal life—in abundance (John 10:10). This eternal life is God's comprehensive solution to the devil's schemes against our health, mind, family, finances, and spiritual walk. The key to walking more consistently in the love and power available through eternal life is twofold: revelation of it and reliance on it. This is not about self-improvement or religious striving; it is about recognizing that Christ's life has become our life, and learning to abide in that transforming truth.

## Key Points

- **There is a gap between how we live and how we should live** - Many believers struggle with obeying God's commands (like loving enemies or forgiving others) because they don't understand the source of their capacity to obey

- **Human effort cannot produce divine love** - Trying to fulfill God's commands through willpower alone leads to frustration, failure, and condemnation; we need a power beyond ourselves

- **Eternal life (Zoe) is distinct from biological life (Bios)** - Biological life energizes the physical body; eternal life energizes the spirit to function as God designed it—to love, believe, and obey as Christ did

- **Eternal life is a present possession, not a future hope** - According to 1 John 5:11-13, believers have eternal life now; it is not something we receive after death but a current reality dwelling in our spirits

- **Eternal life is the very life of Christ Himself** - "God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life" (1 John 5:11-12); eternal life is not just a gift from Christ but Christ Himself living in us

- **God does not improve our human nature; He replaces it** - God doesn't take our old, self-centered life and make it better; He puts it to death and gives us His own divine life instead (Galatians 2:20)

- **Christianity is participating in the life of God** - True Christianity is not following religious rules through human strength but experiencing God's own life energizing and empowering our spirits from within

- **The capacity to love is already present in believers** - Because eternal life is the source of divine love, every believer already possesses the capacity to love as Christ loves; we don't need to create it but to recognize and rely on it

- **Understanding eternal life is essential to New Testament revelation** - Without grasping what it means to have eternal life, we cannot fully understand the gospel or walk in the power of the new covenant

- **Eternal life is God's answer to Satan's attacks** - Jesus came to give us abundant life (John 10:10); eternal life is God's comprehensive solution to everything the enemy tries to do to steal, kill, and destroy

- **Security in God's love enables us to love others** - When we know how deeply Christ loves us (as much as the Father loves Him), we become secure enough to love others without defensiveness or self-protection

- **The key is revelation and reliance** - Walking more fully in the love available through eternal life requires both understanding what we possess and learning to depend on it consistently rather than on our own strength

## Scripture-Based Prayer Points

### 1. Prayer for Revelation of Eternal Life as a Present Reality
**Prayer:** Father, we pray for deep, transforming revelation that eternal life is not a future hope but a present possession. Open our spiritual eyes to see that we have Your life—the life of Christ Himself—dwelling in our spirits right now. Break off every deception that says we will receive eternal life someday; establish the truth in our hearts that we have eternal life today, this moment. Let the reality of this gift settle into the core of our being so that we know that we know that we know we possess the very life of God.

**Scripture:** 1 John 5:11-13 - "And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."

---

### 2. Prayer for Understanding That Christ's Life Is Our Life
**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, we declare that we are crucified with You; nevertheless, we live—yet not we, but You live in us. Break every mindset that sees Christianity as self-improvement or religious performance. Reveal to us that You have not come to improve our old nature but to replace it entirely with Your own divine life. Help us grasp that Your life has literally become our life, that we are one spirit with You, and that the same life that empowered You to love, obey, and overcome is now the fuel energizing our spirits. Let this revelation transform how we approach every challenge and command.

**Scripture:** Galatians 2:20 - "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me." | Colossians 3:3-4 - "For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory."

---

### 3. Prayer for the Capacity to Love Through Eternal Life
**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, we thank You that the capacity to love as Christ loves is already dwelling within us through eternal life. We repent of trying to manufacture love through human effort and willpower. We recognize that divine love is the natural expression of the eternal life You have given us. Energize our spirits with Your love. Let the love of God that has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit flow freely through us to others. Help us to love our enemies, forgive those who offend us, and serve sacrificially—not by striving but by relying on the Zoe life within us.

**Scripture:** Romans 5:5 - "Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us." | 1 John 4:9 - "In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him."

---

### 4. Prayer for Freedom from Condemnation and Self-Effort
**Prayer:** Father, we break off every spirit of condemnation, guilt, and failure that comes from trying to obey Your commands in our own strength. We renounce the frustration of treating Your Word like New Year's resolutions that we cannot keep. Deliver us from the religious mindset that says we must earn Your approval through performance. Let us rest in the finished work of Christ and the reality that Your life in us is sufficient for every command You give. Set us free from the law of sin and death through the higher law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.

**Scripture:** Romans 8:1-2 - "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."

---

### 5. Prayer for Experiencing God's Life in Every Area
**Prayer:** Lord, we receive Your declaration that You came to give us life—eternal life—and life more abundantly. We declare that eternal life is Your answer to every attack of the enemy. Where Satan comes to steal our peace, kill our hope, or destroy our families, finances, and health, we release the power of eternal life. Let this Zoe life manifest in our bodies, bringing healing and strength. Let it manifest in our minds, bringing clarity and soundness. Let it manifest in our relationships, bringing restoration and unity. We refuse to settle for mere biological existence when You have given us abundant, eternal life.

**Scripture:** John 10:10 - "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly." | John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."

---

### 6. Prayer for Security in God's Love
**Prayer:** Father, give us revelation of how much Jesus loves us. Help us comprehend that Jesus loves us exactly as much as You love Him—with the same intensity, the same faithfulness, the same unfailing commitment. Let this truth sink deep into our spirits until we become the most secure people on earth. Remove every insecurity, every need to defend ourselves, every fear of rejection. Let us abide in the revelation of Christ's love for us so firmly that we never move from that place. When we are secure in how much we are loved, we will freely and fearlessly love others.

**Scripture:** John 15:9 - "As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love." | Ephesians 3:17-19 - "That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."

---

### 7. Prayer for Reliance on Eternal Life, Not Human Strength
**Prayer:** Holy Spirit, teach us to rely on the eternal life within us rather than on our own abilities, wisdom, or strength. Break every pattern of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Show us how to draw from the inexhaustible resource of Christ's life in our spirits. Let us learn to pause in every situation and consciously depend on the Zoe life within us. Help us understand that apart from Jesus' life inside us, we can do nothing, but with His life energizing our spirits, we can do all things. Train us to walk by the Spirit, not by the flesh, in every moment of every day.

**Scripture:** John 15:5 - "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing." | Philippians 4:13 - "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

---

### 8. Prayer for the Church to Understand New Covenant Reality
**Prayer:** Father, we pray for Your church to be grounded in the revelation of eternal life. Raise up teachers and preachers who will faithfully proclaim this truth. Break the power of religious thinking that reduces Christianity to moral improvement and rule-keeping. Let Your people understand that they are not just forgiven sinners trying to do better but new creations with the very life of God dwelling within them. Release this revelation across denominations and nations. Let the church move from striving to resting, from self-effort to Spirit-reliance, from condemnation to confidence. Transform Your church by the renewing of our minds to the truth of what we possess in Christ.

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 - "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new." | Romans 12:2 - "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."

---

### 9. Prayer for Believers to Walk in Their True Identity
**Prayer:** Lord, we pray that every believer would know their true identity in Christ. We are not merely forgiven people trying to live better lives; we are those who have died with Christ and been raised to new life—His life. Our old self-centered, condemned nature is dead and gone. Christ Himself is our life now. Let this identity transform how we see ourselves, how we face challenges, how we relate to others, and how we respond to Your Word. Give us boldness to declare, "This life that I have is the life of God in me." Let us live from this identity rather than striving toward it.

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:3-4 - "For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory." | 1 John 5:12 - "He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life."

---

### 10. Prayer for Continuous Meditation on Eternal Life
**Prayer:** Father, we commit ourselves to meditating on the truth of eternal life throughout this week and beyond. Holy Spirit, expand this revelation in our hearts. Give us personal illustrations and insights that make this truth come alive. Help us to chew on these Scriptures, to think about them day and night, to discuss them with fellow believers. Let the doctrine of eternal life move from our heads to our hearts, from information to transformation. As we meditate, speak to us. Teach us. Show us more of what it means that we have Your life dwelling within us. Make this the foundation of our walk with You.

**Scripture:** Psalm 1:2-3 - "But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper." | Joshua 1:8 - "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success."

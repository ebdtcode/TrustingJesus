# Sermon Summary: You MUST Be Born Again!

## Main Theme

Pastor Zangai Peabody delivers a powerful and unapologetic message on the absolute necessity of being born again to comprehend and experience the Kingdom of God. Drawing from Jesus's encounter with Nicodemus in John 3, the pastor addresses the fundamental truth that spiritual rebirth is not optional but essential for entering into relationship with God and understanding spiritual realities. The sermon confronts religious tradition, dead religiosity, and the deception that church attendance or religious activity equates to spiritual life. Pastor Zangai uses the African phrase "Kuku-jumuku" (meaning "if you're not inside, you can't know") to illustrate that spiritual things are incomprehensible to those who remain spiritually dead.

## Key Biblical Foundation

The sermon centers on John 3:1-12, where Nicodemus, a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews, comes to Jesus seeking understanding. Jesus's response is direct and uncompromising: "Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." This encounter reveals that religious knowledge, position, and even sincere seeking cannot substitute for spiritual rebirth. Jesus distinguishes between natural understanding and spiritual comprehension, declaring that "that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:6).

## Central Teaching Points

### 1. The Spiritual Death Inherited from Adam

Pastor Zangai uses the illustration of a master copy DVD to explain how sin entered humanity through Adam. Romans 5:12 teaches that through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin spread to all mankind. Just as a flawed master copy produces flawed duplicates, Adam's fallen nature was transmitted to all his descendants. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are born sinners. This Adamic nature makes us spiritually dead and incapable of comprehending spiritual truth.

### 2. The Natural Man Cannot Receive Spiritual Things

Quoting 1 Corinthians 2:14, the pastor emphasizes that "the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." This explains why even religious leaders like Nicodemus, despite their extensive knowledge of Scripture, cannot grasp spiritual realities without being born again. The sermon illustrates this with Peter's response in Matthew 16:21-23, where Jesus had to rebuke him saying, "You are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."

### 3. The New Birth Through God's Incorruptible Word

The mechanism of new birth is explained through 1 Peter 1:23: "having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever." Just as physical birth requires a seed to be planted in a womb, spiritual birth occurs when the Word of God enters the womb of our spirit through our ears. God operates on us through His Word, imparting His kind of life—not the corrupted life from our earthly lineage, but divine, incorruptible life.

### 4. The Kingdom of God is Righteousness, Peace, and Joy

The pastor clarifies that the kingdom Jesus spoke about is not merely heaven but a present spiritual reality. Luke 17:20-21 declares, "the kingdom of God is within you." Romans 14:17 defines this kingdom as "righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." Being born again grants access to this kingdom—a realm where believers experience God's righteousness (not their own), supernatural peace, and joy that transcends circumstances. This righteousness is not earned but imputed through Christ, who "knew no sin became sin that we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21).

### 5. The Authority and Power of the Born-Again Believer

Proverbs 28:1 declares "the righteous are bold as a lion." The sermon connects this boldness to the authority Jesus displayed—cleansing the temple (Mark 11:27-28), teaching with authority unlike the scribes (Matthew 7:29), healing on the Sabbath, and raising the dead. Born-again believers are backed by God's authority just as police officers are backed by government authority. Proverbs 15:29 promises that "the Lord hears the prayers of the righteous," and James 5:16 declares "the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."

### 6. Being Led by the Spirit as Sons of God

Those who are born again receive a personal GPS—the Holy Spirit's guidance. Romans 8:14 teaches that "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God." The pastor shares a testimony of his wife receiving creative ideas from the Spirit for her teaching work, illustrating how believers are supernaturally directed in practical daily matters. This is the life of walking by faith, where God shows unusual provision and opens doors that natural reasoning cannot explain.

### 7. The Choice: Remaining in Adam or Being in Christ

The sermon concludes with a powerful declaration of choice: "I choose to be in Jesus. I refuse to be in Adam." Galatians 2:20 captures this truth: "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." The old Adamic life must die for Christ's life to reign. Habits, addictions, and patterns from the old lineage can be broken not through self-effort but through the new life in Christ exercised by faith.

## Notable Quotes

- "If you are not inside, you can't know. All right, except you are born again, you can't comprehend this."

- "Man's problem is not that he needs more teaching. Man needs life because man is dead spiritually."

- "I don't have to sin for you to call me a sinner. I am born a sinner. That was my character."

- "Your own righteousness is like filthy rags, but this righteousness is given to us from God."

- "It is not my sinning that gives me my standing in righteousness. No, it's because of who He is and what He did that makes me righteous."

- "People should see signs and wonders. We know that you are on furlough. We know that they took away your employment. How are you making it? I believe in God."

- "I have another source of food that you do not know of. I have another means of supply that you don't know about. You must be born again."

- "For those of you that laughed and scorned, I tell you, born of the Spirit and the blood. I thank God I did not listen to you. By now poverty would have put me on the side."

## Practical Application

The sermon calls for an urgent, decisive response. Pastor Zangai confronts those who may have church positions—ushers, choir members, even teachers and rulers like Nicodemus—but lack the essence of spiritual life. Church attendance, religious rituals, and even doctrinal knowledge cannot substitute for being born again. The time is now to make a conscious decision to receive new life through Jesus Christ. For those already born again, the message calls believers to walk in the authority, righteousness, and Spirit-led life that is their inheritance. Dead situations—relationships, businesses, personal struggles—can come alive through the resurrection power available to those who are truly born again.

## Prayer Points Based on This Sermon

### 1. Prayer for Salvation and New Birth
**Focus:** For those who have never truly been born again

Lord Jesus, I acknowledge that I cannot comprehend spiritual things in my natural state. According to John 3:3, unless I am born again, I cannot see or enter Your kingdom. I confess that I am born in sin through Adam's lineage (Romans 5:12), spiritually dead and unable to save myself. Today I receive Your incorruptible seed, the Word of God (1 Peter 1:23), into my spirit. I believe Jesus Christ died for my sins and rose again. I renounce my old Adamic nature and choose to be in Christ. Make me a new creation. Give me Your divine life, that I may know You and walk in Your kingdom. Save me now, in Jesus's name.

**Scripture:** John 3:3,7; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Romans 10:9-10

### 2. Prayer for Spiritual Understanding and Discernment
**Focus:** For eyes to comprehend spiritual realities

Father, I pray that the eyes of my understanding be enlightened (Ephesians 1:18). Remove the veil of natural thinking that keeps me from discerning spiritual truth. Your Word declares that spiritual things are spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14). Since I am born again, I have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). Open my spiritual eyes to see beyond natural circumstances. Help me to be mindful of things of God, not things of man (Matthew 16:23). Let Your Holy Spirit teach me all things and guide me into all truth (John 16:13). Give me wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ.

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 2:14-16; Ephesians 1:17-18; Matthew 16:23; John 16:13

### 3. Prayer for Walking in Imputed Righteousness
**Focus:** For boldness and confidence in Christ's righteousness

Heavenly Father, I thank You that through Christ, I have become the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21). My own righteousness is as filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6), but Christ's righteousness has been imputed to me. I declare that I am righteous not by my works but by faith in Jesus Christ. According to Proverbs 28:1, the righteous are bold as a lion. I receive this boldness to pray, to witness, and to live victoriously. I refuse condemnation because there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). Let me walk in the confidence that You hear my prayers (Proverbs 15:29) and that I have access to Your throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 5:21; Proverbs 28:1; Romans 8:1; Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 64:6; Hebrews 4:16

### 4. Prayer for Resurrection Power Over Dead Situations
**Focus:** For life to come to dead areas

Lord, just as Jesus called Lazarus from the grave, I call forth resurrection life over every dead situation in my life. You are the God who calls those things that are not as though they were (Romans 4:17). I speak life to dead relationships, dead dreams, dead businesses, and dead hopes. Your Word declares that greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4). I refuse to accept death where You have promised life. According to Ezekiel 37, I prophesy to dry bones: Live! Come alive in the name of Jesus. Let Your resurrection power that raised Christ from the dead (Ephesians 1:19-20) quicken every area of my life.

**Scripture:** John 11:43-44; Romans 4:17; Ezekiel 37:4-5; 1 John 4:4; Ephesians 1:19-20

### 5. Prayer for Being Spirit-Led in Daily Life
**Focus:** For divine guidance and wisdom

Father, Your Word declares that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God (Romans 8:14). I am Your child, born of Your Spirit. Lead me today by Your Holy Spirit. Give me supernatural wisdom and creative ideas for my work, family, and ministry. You promise in James 1:5 that if any lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives liberally. I ask now for wisdom. Order my steps according to Your Word (Psalm 119:133). Let me not lean on my own understanding but acknowledge You in all my ways, and You will direct my paths (Proverbs 3:5-6). Open and close doors according to Your perfect will. Give me divine connections and supernatural provision that only You can arrange.

**Scripture:** Romans 8:14; James 1:5; Proverbs 3:5-6; Psalm 119:133; Psalm 37:23

### 6. Prayer for Effective, Fervent Intercession
**Focus:** For powerful prayer life

Lord Jesus, You intercede for me at the right hand of the Father (Romans 8:34), and You have given me access to pray with authority. Your Word promises that the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much (James 5:16). I am that righteous man through Christ. Teach me to pray according to Your will, praying Your Word back to You. Help me to pray with faith, nothing doubting (James 1:6). Let my prayers be like Moses stretching his rod over the Red Sea—obedient acts of faith that release Your supernatural power. I thank You that You hear me always (John 11:42). Raise up an army of intercessors in this generation who will stand in the gap and see Your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.

**Scripture:** James 5:16; Romans 8:34; 1 John 5:14-15; John 11:42; Hebrews 4:16; Matthew 6:10

### 7. Prayer for Deliverance from Adamic Habits and Patterns
**Focus:** For freedom from old nature's bondage

Father, I thank You that I have been crucified with Christ (Galatians 2:20). My old man was crucified with Him that the body of sin might be done away with (Romans 6:6). I am dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus (Romans 6:11). I refuse to let sin reign in my mortal body (Romans 6:12). Every habit, addiction, and pattern from the Adamic line—I declare them dead in Jesus's name. I cannot break these chains by myself, but in Christ, I can do all things (Philippians 4:13). Where sin abounded, grace abounds much more (Romans 5:20). I exercise my faith now to walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4). Set me free by Your Spirit and Your truth (John 8:32,36).

**Scripture:** Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:6,11,12; Romans 5:20; Philippians 4:13; John 8:32,36; Romans 6:4

### 8. Prayer for Kingdom Life: Righteousness, Peace, and Joy
**Focus:** For experiencing the present reality of God's kingdom

Heavenly Father, Your kingdom is not just a future hope but a present reality. Jesus declared that the kingdom of God is within me (Luke 17:21). Your kingdom is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). I receive Your righteousness by faith. I receive Your peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7). I receive Your joy that is my strength (Nehemiah 8:10). No matter what circumstances I face, I choose to walk in kingdom reality. Let Your rule and reign be established in every area of my life. Let people around me see signs and wonders that cause them to ask, "By what authority do you operate?" and give me opportunities to testify of Your goodness and the new life I have in Christ.

**Scripture:** Luke 17:21; Romans 14:17; Philippians 4:7; Nehemiah 8:10; Matthew 6:10,33

### 9. Prayer for Bold Witness and Testimony
**Focus:** For courage to share the gospel

Lord, give me holy boldness to declare that I am born again. Just as Pastor Zangai boldly testified despite persecution and mockery, strengthen me to stand firm in my testimony. Your Word says in Romans 1:16 that I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation. Give me opportunities to share with those who are spiritually dead, sitting in churches but lacking true life. Let my life be a testimony of Your transforming power. Use my story—how You brought me from death to life, from poverty to provision, from defeat to victory—to draw others to salvation. Fill my mouth with Your words (Exodus 4:12). Let signs and wonders follow those who believe (Mark 16:17).

**Scripture:** Romans 1:16; Acts 1:8; Mark 16:17; 2 Timothy 1:7; 1 Peter 3:15; Exodus 4:12

### 10. Prayer of Thanksgiving for New Life in Christ
**Focus:** Gratitude and celebration of salvation

Father, I thank You that I am born again! Not of corruptible seed but incorruptible through the living Word of God (1 Peter 1:23). I thank You that I am no longer in Adam but in Christ (1 Corinthians 15:22). I am a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new (2 Corinthians 5:17). I thank You for rescuing me from the domain of darkness and transferring me into the kingdom of Your beloved Son (Colossians 1:13). I celebrate that my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life (Revelation 21:27). I rejoice that I have passed from death to life (John 5:24). Thank You for the indescribable gift of salvation (2 Corinthians 9:15). Let my life be a perpetual offering of praise to Your name.

### 11. Prayer for the Church to Walk in True Spiritual Life
**Focus:** Corporate prayer for authentic Christianity

Lord Jesus, You are the Head of the Church, and we are Your body (Colossians 1:18). I pray for Your Church worldwide—that we would not merely have a form of godliness while denying its power (2 Timothy 3:5). Awaken those who sit in pews but have never truly been born again. Expose dead religion and kindle fresh fire. Let Your Church arise with the authority Jesus demonstrated—teaching with power, healing the sick, raising the dead, and cleansing lepers (Matthew 10:8). Raise up a generation that walks in righteousness, peace, and joy—demonstrating the kingdom of God. Let the world see such signs and wonders that they cannot help but ask about the source of our authority. Revive Your Church, oh Lord!

**Scripture:** 2 Timothy 3:5; Colossians 1:18; Acts 2:42-47; Matthew 10:8; Ephesians 5:25-27; Acts 4:29-31

### 12. Prayer for Perseverance and Victory in Faith
**Focus:** Standing firm in the new life

Father, I declare with Apostle Paul that I have been crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me (Galatians 2:20). I refuse to be moved by what I see or feel but will walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7). Give me perseverance to run the race set before me, keeping my eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith (Hebrews 12:1-2). When trials come, remind me that this new life is indestructible because it is Christ's life. Help me to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony (Revelation 12:11). I am more than a conqueror through Christ who loves me (Romans 8:37). Victory is mine in Jesus's name!

**Scripture:** Galatians 2:20; 2 Corinthians 5:7; Hebrews 12:1-2; Revelation 12:11; Romans 8:37; 1 John 5:4

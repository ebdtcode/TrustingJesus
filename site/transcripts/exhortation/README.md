## Exhortation Details

**Title:** Making is Greater Than Blessing
**Speaker:** Unknown
**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Church:** Harvest Intercontinental Church - Olney
**Type:** Exhortation on Biblical Giving
**Duration:** 8 minutes, 10 seconds

## Overview

This exhortation challenges believers to understand that God's purpose in calling us to give is not primarily about receiving blessings, but about transforming us into the image of Christ. The speaker addresses two extremes: giving to get blessed, and not giving because we feel we already have enough.

## Context

This exhortation was delivered following the sermon "The Secret of Victory Over Sin, Satan And Self" by Bishop Dr. Darlingston Johnson on October 20, 2025. It was extracted from the YouTube live stream at timestamp 1:05:55 to 1:14:05.

## Key Themes

1. **Character Formation Through Giving** - God uses giving to shape us into Christ's image
2. **God's Priority** - Making us like Christ is more important than blessing us
3. **Two Dangers** - Giving for personal gain vs. not giving due to self-sufficiency
4. **The Laodicean Warning** - The Western church's danger of spiritual complacency
5. **Christlike Generosity** - Sacrificial giving as spiritual transformation

## Scripture References

- **1 Timothy 6:3-5** - Warning against viewing godliness as a means of gain
- **2 Corinthians 8-9** - Principles of generous giving and blessing
- **Revelation 2** - The church of Laodicea (rich but spiritually poor)
- **2 Corinthians 8** - Jesus' example of sacrificial giving

## Key Points

1. God's primary goal is to make us into the image of His Son, not merely to bless us
2. We should not give to gain blessings or out of need, but to become like Christ
3. The church in the West faces the Laodicean danger of self-sufficiency
4. Jesus gave knowing many would not respond - we are called to the same sacrificial generosity
5. Giving detaches our hearts from material things and attaches us to the Lord

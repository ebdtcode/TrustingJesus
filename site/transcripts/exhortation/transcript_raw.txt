 So I'm here to exhortance just a little bit, please if you can keep playing. I'm here to exhortance just a little bit on maybe the topic or the issue of giving. And this is small but if I had to give a title to it, it would be called making is greater than blessing. Making is greater than blessing. God wants to make you into the person that you're supposed to be more than he wants to bless you. He wants to make you into the image of his son. Even as you've already been made in your spirit, he wants to make you up. He wants to make you also in character, in action, in attitude, just like his son. And one of the ways that he does that is actually by giving. I don't have time to go through all of these scriptures but one of the scriptures that I found was 1 Timothy chapter 6 starting from verse 3. If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to hold some words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which accords with Godliness, he is proud knowing nothing but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of truth who suppose that Godliness is a means of gain from which from such with joyousness. So there's one side to people who give and it's those who give out of need. You've probably heard from any pastor anywhere that if you give you will be blessed. And according to 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, it's true if you give you will be blessed. But we don't give in order to be blessed. Again, God's aim is to make us more than it is to bless us because there are blessed men today who haven't been made by God and they're causing terror all over the earth. There are blessed men, like physically blessed, who can pay for all of your stuff, who can take you anywhere you want to go, who can do anything. And they're the most depressed, the most sorrowful people you've ever met. So blessing is not the aim. And then over and above all of that, please wait, please wait, please wait. Over and above all of that, we're already blessed. So adding blessings to you is not going to help you because you've been blessed already. His goal again is to make you. So that's one side. There are those who give because they're trying to be blessed and that's not how we give. Then there's another side. And I found this in Revelation chapter 2. I can't go there. But in Revelation chapter 2, you'll find a church, the le Odysseus. And Jesus comes and speaks to those le Odysseus and he says to them, you've said to yourself that you're rich and you need nothing. And yet because you've said to yourself that you're rich and you need nothing, you don't even realize that you're naked. There are things from me that you need to buy that you haven't bought. Why? Because you've convinced yourself that you have all that you need. And one thing that you'll find out is that in the church in the West, the church in America, compared to everybody else with the richest church, compared to everybody else, we have the most physical things, so to speak. We actually have the most freedom to preach, so to speak. We have the most liberty to do everything that we want to do. And because we find ourselves in a place where we can be comfortable, because we find ourselves in a place where we don't necessarily have, you know, you have to stress too much, you get stressed, but you have to stress too much. Because we find ourselves in that position, you don't need to be blessed. So if for you, blessing is about giving. I mean giving is about blessing and you're already blessed. Why give? If giving is about blessing and you're already blessed, then there's no reason to give. But the idea, again, is that God never asks you to do something just for you. God never asks you to give something just for the sake of telling you to do it. He's trying to make you just like him. He's trying to have you look just like him walk, just like him talk, but just like him. So concerning giving, the Lord is expecting of us that we give just as He gave. If you go to the book of 2nd Corinthians, I believe that's chapter 8, you'll find that our motive for giving, not just of our time and our time, but also of our treasure, is because Jesus first gave. And guess what? He gave knowing that there are people who won't give back. He gave knowing that there are people who won't respond to the gift that He gave. As believers, our aim is Christ. And so even though sometimes giving makes no sense, the point is not necessarily the giving as much as it is who you are becoming by giving. There's somebody that you're being made into when you offer up your resources. There's a way that your heart becomes detached from physical things and starts to look at the Lord when you're willing to give the thing that supposedly gives you life and offer it to the Lord. We have to see that if we have, and I even wrote it here, we have to see that if we have peace that surpasses all understanding, if we have joy that is unspeakable and we have hope that is unlike this world, it only follows that our generosity. It will be beyond anything that normally makes sense. There's a way that people give sometimes as we see in Scripture. Even when they don't have, they still give. And in that generosity, they find themselves looking just like Jesus. Our goal, our repeated again, is to look like Him. It's to walk like Him. It's to talk like Him. And if there's anything in your life that will keep you from looking like Him, it's those things that we won't allow to be modeled after Him. He wants us to give our lives. He wants us to give our substance, not because He's money hungry, but because He's hungry for you. He's hungry for your life. He lives inside of you and he wants to have so much control that when men and women and children and people see you, they say that person looks just like Jesus. That person walks just like Jesus. That person talks just like Jesus. So please, can we show the ways to give? I want us to give. I want us to give. Not out of coercion, not because we're twisting your arm, but because God is on a mission to make people look like Him. Can we show the ways of giving? I should have coming around with the... The envelopes. If you need to give, please see them. Watch them raising their hands. When we give, we'll notice that from giving our money, we'll give our time, we'll give our lives and people will be blessed. One more thing and then I'll go. I got the opportunity to meet that man, Reverend David Kawala, I don't remember his name. And that guy, they told us he used to go in the jungle. He would be going all kinds of places to preach the gospel. I don't know if we heard what was in that video. He said he went from a small meeting to 14 congregations, that's 14 churches. Why? Because he has an attitude of giving. People who give. People who know how to give of themselves. The Lord looks for them. He looks for them to use them, to place His hand on them. So my encouragement to you is that we would be those people who give, again, not because we want to be blessed, not because we want a plus, but because our...

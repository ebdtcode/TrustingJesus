## "A Gift For You" - Bishop Darlingston Johnson

---

## SERMON SUMMARY

**Main Theme:** Jesus Christ is God's personal gift to each individual - a gift that must be unwrapped, received personally, and celebrated as the fulfillment of God's eternal promise.

On December 29, 2025, Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivered a powerful Christmas message centered on Luke 2:10-11, where the angel announced to the shepherds: "For there is born to you this day in the city of David, a Savior who is Christ the Lord." This sermon masterfully unpacks the profound truth that salvation is not merely a corporate blessing for humanity, but a deeply personal gift with each believer's name on it.

**Key Theological Points:**

**1. God Chooses the Excluded and Marginalized**

Bishop Johnson emphasizes that God deliberately chose shepherds - society's rejects, the unclean, those at the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder - to receive history's most important announcement. The angel didn't appear in a king's palace or beautiful temple, but in a quiet field at midnight to people who had been excluded, looked down upon, and treated as though they didn't matter. This reveals God's heart: He doesn't value people according to worldly titles, education, possessions, or positions. Every person has equal worth and value in God's eyes.

The application is twofold: First, never think you're better than someone because of education, titles (President, Vice President, Director, Doctor, Reverend, CEO), possessions, or social standing. Second, never think you're inferior to anyone because you lack these things. God's love and purposes for you are just as important as His plans for anyone else.

**2. The Gospel Is Personally For You - "Unto YOU"**

The sermon's most powerful insight concerns the three critical words: "unto you." Bishop Johnson explains that if the angels had only said "good news for all people," the shepherds likely would have excluded themselves from that group due to years of internalized rejection. They would have heard "all people" but not seen themselves included.

Many believers do the same today - they hear God's promises but disqualify themselves based on self-evaluation, comparison with others, or what they've heard about themselves. The tragedy is that people exclude themselves from blessings God has freely given. Jesus is the gift to all people, but He is also God's gift to ME. Your name is on that gift.

**3. Unwrap the Gift - Don't Leave It Wrapped**

Using a tender illustration about his granddaughter Anna receiving a large dollhouse for Christmas, Bishop Johnson emphasizes that the gift must be unwrapped to be enjoyed. Anna's name was on the gift, so she unwrapped it, took possession of it, appropriated it, and began enjoying its blessings. She was surprised by how big it actually was once unwrapped.

Similarly, believers must personally unwrap Jesus to understand what they truly have. Many Christians lack joy not because they don't have the gift, but because they haven't unwrapped it. God has provided help for this unwrapping process - the Holy Spirit, pastors, and fellow believers. The greater the revelation of who Jesus is, the greater the joy will be.

**4. Our Faith Is Rooted in History, Not Myth**

Bishop Johnson anchors the Christmas message in historical reality. This is not abstract philosophy, fables, or myth. On a certain day in history, during King Augustus's reign, in the particular city of Bethlehem, a baby was born. Shepherds saw Him. He grew up in Nazareth, walked Israel's streets for 33 years, worked as a carpenter's son, performed miracles for three years, was crucified, died, and rose on the third day. There were eyewitnesses - women who saw the empty tomb, disciples who touched the risen Christ.

This matters because we're not worshiping our imagination or using a made-up crutch to cope. Jesus is a real Savior who provides real salvation for real people with real needs.

**5. God Always Keeps His Word - From "He Will Come" to "He Has Come"**

For approximately 5,000 years, from Genesis through Malachi, God promised that the Savior would come. The seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head (Genesis 3:15). Through all the prophets - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Isaiah, Jeremiah, all the way to Malachi - the consistent message was "He will come."

Then came 400 years of silence - no prophets, no public pronouncements, only the written Word to hold onto. But silence doesn't mean God has forgotten. At the fullness of time, "He will come" changed to "He has come." Over 400 prophecies were fulfilled to the letter. What God spoke 5,000 years earlier came to pass exactly as promised.

This is crucial for believers today who have heard from God but are experiencing silence. God may seem to have forgotten, but He has not. No word of God is void of power. No word of God will return void. It is impossible for God's word not to come to pass - it's the very nature of His word. If you're not hearing fresh words from the Lord, go back and remind yourself of what is already written.

**6. God Is a "This Day" God**

While we can look back at what God did yesterday and look forward to what He will do tomorrow, Bishop Johnson emphasizes that our God is a "this day" God. This day, Christ is your Savior. This day, Christ is your Lord. This day, God is answering prayer, working miracles, giving breakthroughs, guiding your steps, protecting you, preserving you, working in your life and family, being faithful, good, and merciful.

We serve a right now God and an on-time God. Don't just live in memories of past victories or future hopes - experience God's presence and power TODAY.

**7. The Gift Is God Himself**

The word "Lord" in Luke 2:11 is the translation of the Hebrew and Greek words for God. The profound truth is that in Christ, the giver is God and the gift is God. God has not only given you a gift - God has given you God.

If God has given you God, then this day God has given you the answer (because God IS the answer), the breakthrough (because God IS the breakthrough), the healer and the healing (because God IS).

**Practical Application and Response:**

The shepherds believed the good news, acted upon it (they said "let's go and see"), went to Bethlehem, and then told everyone what they had heard and seen. Believers must:
1. Believe the good news that Jesus is their personal Savior
2. Act upon this truth
3. Tell the whole world - proclaim it, because He's not just a gift for you but for all people

The sermon concludes with an altar call, inviting people to receive Jesus as both Savior and Lord, recognizing that only as Lord can He save us.

## SCRIPTURE-BASED PRAYER POINTS

### 1. **For Recognition of Personal Value in God's Eyes**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would grasp their infinite worth to God, regardless of worldly status, and reject all feelings of inferiority or superiority.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2:10-11 - God sent the most important announcement in history to shepherds, society's rejects; 1 Samuel 16:7 - "The Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart"

**Prayer Declaration:** Father, we thank You that You don't value us according to titles, education, possessions, or social standing. Just as You chose shepherds - the excluded, the looked-down-upon, those treated as though they didn't matter - to receive the announcement of Jesus' birth, You choose us. Forgive us for times we've felt inferior because we lack worldly credentials, and forgive us for times we've felt superior because we possess them. Help us to stand straight, lift up our heads, and look others in the face knowing that we are just as valuable in Your eyes as anyone else. Break off every chain of comparison, every weight of low self-esteem, and every root of pride. Let us know deep in our hearts: I am somebody because I am God's child. Where we are becomes exalted when You show up, because Your presence makes everything holy. We are temples of the Holy Spirit - You live in us - therefore we are exalted places. Help us to stop excluding ourselves when You have included us.

### 2. **For Personal Appropriation of Jesus as OUR Gift**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would receive Jesus personally, recognizing that their specific name is on the gift of salvation.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2:10-11 - "Unto YOU is born this day a Savior"; John 1:12 - "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name"

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord Jesus, we declare today that You are not just the gift to the world - You are the gift to ME. My name is on this gift of salvation. Just as the angel said "unto you" to the shepherds, You say "unto you" to me. I refuse to exclude myself from Your promises based on my self-evaluation, my comparison with others, or what people have said about me. Though You love the whole world, You also love me individually and personally. I am not looking at myself to determine if I qualify - I'm looking at You, the giver. You had me on Your mind when You sent Jesus. This good news is for me. Help me to stop disqualifying myself from blessings You have freely given. I receive You, I take possession of You, I appropriate You, and I will begin to enjoy the fullness of all that You are. Jesus, You are MY Savior, MY Lord, MY answer, MY breakthrough, MY everything.

### 3. **For Help in Unwrapping the Gift of Jesus**
**Prayer Focus:** That the Holy Spirit, pastors, and fellow believers would help us fully understand and experience all that we have in Christ.

**Scripture Foundation:** Ephesians 1:17-18 - "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints"

**Prayer Declaration:** Holy Spirit, help me to unwrap the gift of Jesus so I can truly see what I have. I confess that I've left so much of Jesus wrapped up - I haven't taken full possession of all that You've given me in Christ. Like Bishop's granddaughter who was surprised at how big her gift was once unwrapped, surprise me with the magnitude of who Jesus is. Give me revelation upon revelation of His love, His power, His presence, His provision. If I lack joy, it's because I haven't unwrapped the gift - so help me experience the joy of salvation in greater measure. Thank You for sending the Holy Spirit to lead me into all truth, for providing pastors and teachers to help me understand Your Word, and for placing me in community with other believers who can help me grasp the fullness of Christ. Open my eyes to see Jesus more clearly. The greater my revelation of who He is, the greater my joy will be. Let me unwrap Jesus today and every day, discovering more and more of His beauty, majesty, and goodness.

### 4. **For Anchoring Faith in the Historical Reality of Jesus**
**Prayer Focus:** That our faith would be firmly rooted in the historical facts of Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2 - The historical narrative of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem during Caesar Augustus's reign; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 - "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once"

**Prayer Declaration:** Father, we thank You that our faith is not based on myths, fables, abstract principles, or human philosophy. Our faith is rooted in history. On a certain day in history, during the reign of King Augustus, in the particular city of Bethlehem, Jesus was born. Shepherds saw Him. He grew up in Nazareth. He walked the streets of Israel for 33 years. He performed miracles - raising the dead, multiplying five loaves and two fish, speaking to winds and waves that obeyed Him. He was arrested, crucified, and died. But on the third day, He rose from the dead. There were eyewitnesses - women who saw the empty tomb, disciples who touched Him, over 500 who saw the risen Christ. This is not my imagination. This is not a crutch I invented to cope. This is REAL. Jesus is a REAL Savior providing REAL salvation for my REAL needs. Strengthen my faith on this foundation of historical truth. When doubts come, remind me that Jesus is not a fairy tale but the central figure of human history whose life, death, and resurrection are documented and testified to by eyewitnesses. I worship a real Savior who really rose from the dead and really lives today.

### 5. **For Trusting God's Faithfulness During Seasons of Silence**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers experiencing silence from God would remember His faithfulness and trust that His promises will come to pass.

**Scripture Foundation:** Isaiah 55:11 - "So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void"; Numbers 23:19 - "God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do?"; Habakkuk 2:3 - "For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry"

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, I thank You that Your word is sure. For 5,000 years You promised "He will come" - through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, all the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, all the way to Malachi. Then came 400 years of silence - no prophets, no fresh words - only what You had already spoken. But silence didn't mean You had forgotten. At the fullness of time, "He will come" became "He has come." Over 400 prophecies fulfilled to the letter. What You spoke thousands of years earlier came to pass exactly as promised. Father, I confess I'm in a season where I've heard from You but now there's silence. It seems like You've forgotten. It looks like You're not keeping Your promise. But this story encourages me, strengthens me, and builds my faith. No word of Yours is void of power. No word of Yours will return void. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Your word not to come to pass - it's the very nature of Your word. Has He said it? Then He WILL do it. I will not doubt what You've said during the years of silence. I will go back and remind myself of what is written. I will meditate on Your promises. Your word was true in Genesis and it's true in 2025. Your word remains true 1,000 years, 2,000 years, 5,000 years later. What You promised me WILL come to pass.

### 6. **For Experiencing God's "This Day" Presence and Power**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would encounter God's active presence, power, and faithfulness TODAY, not just in memories or future hopes.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2:11 - "For there is born to you THIS DAY a Savior"; Hebrews 13:8 - "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever"; Psalm 118:24 - "This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it"

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, I thank You that You are not just the God of yesterday or the God of tomorrow - You are my "this day" God. Yes, I can look back at yesterday and see evidence that You are true, that Your word comes to pass, that You've answered prayers and worked miracles. Yes, I can look at tomorrow and know You have things prepared for me, and that Jesus is coming back. But I don't want to live only in memories of past victories or future hopes. THIS DAY, You are my Savior. THIS DAY, You are my Lord. THIS DAY, You are answering my prayers. THIS DAY, You are working miracles. THIS DAY, You are giving me breakthroughs. THIS DAY, You are guiding and ordering my steps. THIS DAY, You are protecting me and preserving me. THIS DAY, You are working in my life and my family. THIS DAY, You are being faithful, good, and merciful. THIS DAY, You are God. THIS DAY, You are Jesus. I serve a right-now God. I serve an on-time God. Let me experience Your presence and power not just as historical truth or future promise, but as present reality. Meet me where I am right now, in this moment, in my current circumstances, tests, and trials.

### 7. **For Revelation That God Himself Is the Gift**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would grasp that in receiving Jesus, we receive God Himself - the ultimate answer to every need.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2:11 - "A Savior who is Christ the LORD" (Lord = Yahweh, God); Colossians 2:9 - "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily"; John 14:9 - "He who has seen Me has seen the Father"

**Prayer Declaration:** Father, help me grasp this profound truth: the gift IS God. In Christ, the giver is God and the gift is God. You have not only given me a gift - You have given me GOD. Jesus is not just a blessing among many blessings - He is the embodiment of all of God given to me. Because You have given me God, this day You have given me the answer (because You ARE the answer). This day You have given me the breakthrough (because You ARE the breakthrough). This day You have given me the healer and the healing (because You ARE the healer). This day You have given me strength (because You ARE my strength), peace (because You ARE my peace), provision (because You ARE my provider), protection (because You ARE my shield and fortress), wisdom (because You ARE wisdom), righteousness (because You ARE my righteousness), hope (because You ARE my hope). I don't just receive gifts FROM God - I receive God Himself in Christ Jesus. What more could I possibly need when I have God? All that God is, is mine in Christ. This is truly good news that produces great joy. Let this revelation sink deep into my spirit and transform how I live.

### 8. **For Bold Witness and Proclamation**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would follow the shepherds' example - believing, acting upon the truth, and telling everyone what they've seen and heard.

**Scripture Foundation:** Luke 2:17-18 - "Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child. And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds"; Mark 16:15 - "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature"

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, like the shepherds who believed the good news, said "let's go and see," went to Bethlehem, and then told everyone what they had heard and seen, help me to respond rightly to this gift of Jesus. I believe this good news - that unto me is born this day a Savior who is Christ the Lord. I will act upon this truth, receiving Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior. And I will not keep my mouth shut. I will tell the whole world because Jesus is not just a gift for me - He's a gift for all people. Give me boldness to proclaim the good news. Give me opportunities to share what I've seen and heard. Let my testimony of Jesus bring others to encounter Him. Help me to make widely known the things You've revealed to me about Christ. May my life and my words point others to the Savior. Let me be a messenger of this good news of great joy that shall be to all people. Unto them is born this day in the city of David, a Savior who is Christ the Lord. This is the message the world needs to hear - and I will declare it.

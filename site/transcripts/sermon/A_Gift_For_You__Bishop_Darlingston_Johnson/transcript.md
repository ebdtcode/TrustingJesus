Are you ready for the word? All right, Papa, we thank you for the word of God that will not return to you void and Holy Spirit, I thank you for your ministry, which is to take up the things of Jesus and reveal them through us. We know you're faithful and so we expect that you will speak and Christ would be revealed to it. All of us would behold Him and be transformed from one degree of glory to another in Jesus name. Amen city, your neighbor, I'm about to experience transformation in Jesus name. All right, go to Luke chapter two and the verses that we're going to focus on in Luke chapter two are verse 10 and verse 11. And verse 10 reads, then the angels said to them, do not be afraid. For behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people, let's read that together. Then the angels said to them the shepherds, that them there are the shepherds. Do not be afraid. For behold, I bring you good tidings good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people verse 11. For there is born to you this day in the city of David, a savior who is Christ the Lord. That was the angel of the Lord bringing a special message to the shepherds while they kept watch over their sheep by night. Most of us should be familiar with the story. Luke chapter two. Until you is born this day in the city of David, a savior who is who is who Christ the Lord. That announcement by that angel changed history. Luke tells us that 2000 years ago in the middle of an ordinary night on a cold winter morning, heaven interrupted earth. While the world was asleep, God was awake. Isn't that wonderful? The Bible says he never sleeps, nor slumber, somebody needs to be encouraged by that. Hey, man, your God isn't sleeping. Your God knows where you are. If you are on a field at night on a cold winter morning today, know this, he knows where you are. No, he's not sleeping. But on this particular day, heaven interrupted earth and this announcement was made by the angel that changed everything. City and neighbor, it changed everything. Hallelujah. The angel said to the shepherds, I bring you good news. Hey, man, of glad tidings of great joy that would be to all people. I have a question for you, is it still good news? Is it good news for you? If he came for you, I want you to say he came for me. City and neighbor, that is good news. I want you to take note of the scene that night. The angel came, made the most important announcement in history. But the announcement was not made in a king's palace. The announcement was not made in a beautiful temple. This most important announcement in church history took place in a quiet field at midnight. So God is so different. They've got to help us to think and interpret and understand the way he does. Because if it had been you or me, we would have had microphones. We would have had to press. Hey, man, the reporters from the Jerusalem post would have been there. But that night when the most important announcement ever made that church history was announced by an angel and then angels, there were no microphones, no headlines, no reporters, just shepherds, say just shepherds. Now, if you know anything about shepherds in that day, they were not importing people. They were not respected. They were never invited to anything. They were considered really unclean. And on the socio-economic ladder, they were at the lowest. They did not live in nice houses, they did not wear nice clothes. Yet that night into determining who he would send this most important message to. God decided I'm gonna send them to shepherds. Say hallelujah. Now think about it. I'm gonna send them to shepherds. Who are keeping watch over sheep in the field? People who have been excluded, people who are looked down upon, people who are treated as though they do not matter. Those who the world had rejected are the ones that God chose. I don't know how you see yourself and what you feel about who you are. But let me just make two applications here. First, never think you're better than someone because you've got education. Never think you're better than someone because you have a position with a title. You've got a title before your name. President, vice president, director, doctor. Reverend, and on and on. Don't think CEO that you are better than anyone just because of a position you occupy the level of education you have, the car you drive, the house you live and the clothes you wear. And don't ever make the mistake of thinking that God thinks that you're better than anyone because of those titles. That night he sent the angels with the most important message to shepherds. Don't make that mistake. And don't make the other mistake. Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are inferior to anyone because you don't have the title before your name or the letters after your name. You don't have the house, you don't have the car, you don't have the Louis Vuitton, you don't have the whatever. Never look at someone and determine who you are and your value based upon those types of things. Remember that night God sent his angels not to the kings, not to those who were celebrated by men as being big and important people in God's eyes. Those shepherds were just as important and just as valuable had the same amount of value and worth in his eyes. He loved them just as much as he loved every other person, regardless of their outward accomplishments. So don't make the mistake. Give respect to people who to whom respect is you but don't ever feel that you're inferior to anybody that you love less or that worth as much. Never feel you have to bow your head because you're not equal and you can't look at someone's face. Now I'm not saying disregard your traditions at home. I'm just saying do allow yourself to think that you are. So you're inferior to someone else. Therefore, you cannot look at them face to face because of some type of position of wealth. God doesn't value you in that way. So if you have been one of those who have been looking down upon yourselves and thinking you're not worthy because you know this, you keep comparing yourself with other people and making yourself feel so bad, hear the good news today, unto you. Say unto you, amen. So therefore you can stand straight, you can lift up your head and you can be willing to look at any man in the face and say God loves me, I am as valuable as you. God has a purpose, God has a plan for me that is as important to him as any plan he has for anybody else. Are you hear me? Stop excluding yourself because men exclude you. Stop letting the opinions of men be what determine who you are and how you see yourself. Stop trying so hard. So impress men, it doesn't matter. Hey man, it meant some of you are not resting. You are working and working and working and the only thing that has you to do all of that is because you want to impress men. You want to look good in the eyes of men because I'm telling men say they like you, you can't like yourself. I've come to tell you God likes you. I've come to tell you this morning, this story says God loves you. That you're important. Are you hear me say I am somebody because I am God's amen. So that night the angel came into the field where the shepherds were. I placed that society would reject. That's where God came. And if God came there to meet them, God will come where you are. Wherever you are. And when God shows up where you are, where you are becomes. I hear me the most important place, the most holy place, the most exalted place because when God is there, his presence makes everything exalted. All right, turn to the person next to you and say, did you hear what Bishop just said? Are you a believer? Say you're the temple of the Holy Ghost. God moved into you. God lives in you. That makes you an exalted place. Say hallelujah. Now when the angel appeared, the Bible says the shepherds responded and the way they responded was to be afraid. They were afraid. Unfortunately, that response is far too common. Two million people respond to God as though he's somebody to be afraid of. It sounded all the way back in the book of Genesis. Remember, God created Adam and Eve. God placed them in the garden and was so beautiful. God provided everything for them. And then Adam and Eve said, And when God came into the garden looking for them, the Scripture tells us Adam and Eve were hiding. And when God found them the question he asked was, where are you and Adam said, we were afraid. But there was no need to be afraid. God already knew what they had done. And when he came walking in the cool of the day, he wasn't surprised to find out he knew what had happened. But he wasn't coming there that day in order to scare them. He was coming in order to save them. When the Lord put an angel or angels around the tree of light, it was the saved Adam and Eve because he didn't want them to partake of that. Had they partaken of the tree of light, they would have remained perpetually in that state that they had just placed themselves in. So when God came that day, it was to protect them. To preserve them. To provide a means of escape. To rescue them from the mess that they had placed themselves in. And so on that particular day when he came and he spoke to them and he spoke of what would happen, he put them out. All of that was to save them. But they were scared when they should have been glad. Instead of hiding, they should have been running to him so we made a mess help us because we can't help ourselves. One day Jesus came walking on the sea to the disciples. They were on the boat. There was a huge storm. They were afraid because the storm threatened to destroy their lives. And then Christ comes in the midst of the storm and they see him and they're afraid to think he's a ghost. And here the shepherds are doing the same thing. The angels appear. They're sent by God with a message for them and their response is to be afraid when really what they should have done. Instead of cowering in fear, instead of being terrified by what they saw, the sight of the angels should have caused them to rejoice because God did not send the angel to harm them. He sent the angel to arm them with the truth concerning Jesus. Let me repeat, there was no need for them to be afraid. Their response to God should have been over. The response to the angel should have been to be joyful, to be glad to see the angel but they were afraid because they were so conscious of their sin. So conscious of their wrongdoing. They were afraid and they thought that the angel was coming to bring judgment. And so they were scared, but God did not send the angel to those shepherds at night in order to scare them. He sent the angels at night in order to save them in order to arm them with the truth concerning Christ. Who had been born? Notice what the angel said to them? The angel said, be not. The angel didn't say, be afraid. The angel said, what? What did the angel say? Yeah, be not afraid. Fear not. Why? Because he wasn't bringing bad news. He was bringing good news. I've brought this day to you. Good news that were produced. Produced what? Great joy. Good news that produces great joy. That's the gospel. The gospel we proclaim concerning Jesus is always good news. And when people hear the good news, and I hope you're hearing the good news and you will continue to hear the good news in this world. There's so much bad news. CNN and Fox and MS now. And wherever you turn, it's not the good news. They focus on as always the bad news. We need to hear good news. And thank God we as believers, we who are in this church have good news. Are you hear me? Good news that if we would pay attention to and keep listening to, we'll produce great joy. Say, Hallelujah. How many of you want some joy today? Then I bring you good news. Until you this day is born. A savior who is. Oh, you don't sound like you believe it. You don't sound like you believe it. Say, say to the person next to you. Until you. It's born this day. A savior. Hallelujah. A savior who brings great joy. Have you contemplated him lately? Have you spent enough time meditating upon who he is and what he has done and what he has brought? Have you considered why the news of his birth produces such great joy and is such good news? For all people. Now that night, the angel, again, knowing who they were speaking to, understanding that these were shepherds who had always been excluded and who had always been put down and as a result, would themselves by their own thinking exclude themselves from anything special. As you see, when you've been put down and put down and put down all your life, it seems like people have been putting you down. And when the opinions of people matter to you and matter to you, you can get to the point where you actually are controlled in your mind by those thoughts and you become your horse enemy. You become your number one critic. You agree with them more than they themselves are intending because you have, you have, it imbibed, you have, you have taken into yourself. There, there, there were a succession degree that you now are excluding yourself. And so hear me, guys, if the angels had only said that night, we bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all people. If the angels had stopped there, those shepherds would not have included themselves in that group. That this message was centered. They would have said to all people, but they would not have seen themselves as a part of it. Their promises God makes, and some of you don't see yourself as included. For God to love the world and you question when a God loves you. I hear me, there are many promises that God makes and he makes all of his children, but there is a huge bunch of us who are not able to see ourselves walking in the fulfillment of those promises because for some reason we don't believe the promise applies to us because we're not looking at the giver, we're looking at ourselves. And we just qualify ourselves for that which God has given to us. I am preaching better than you listening. Hear me, if the angels had only said, this is good news for all people, they shepherds would have been there and said, oh, I wish I was part of that group. They would have excluded themselves. That is why God made sure that the angels said to them, that it is three words, four, I'm two, you. Good news for all people. And by the way, that includes you shepherds. Good news for all people and all people means you. God was to know that he had you two on his mind when he decided to do what he just did. Are you hearing me? God wanted to say to them, you are included. In what I'm doing, do not exclude yourself based upon how you have felt about yourself or based upon what you have heard about yourself based upon your evaluation of yourself, based upon your comparison with others, do not exclude yourself because this good news is for you shepherds too. I'm gonna say here, because somebody needs to know that Jesus died for you too. Somebody needs to know that a savior was born for you too. Somebody needs to know that this gift that is being offered the whole world has your name on it. Jesus is the gift from God to all people, but he's also God's gift to me. Oh God, help me to help somebody to hear this. I don't know how many of you got Christmas gifts. I didn't know and I got one or two. Amen, but it had my name on it. We had gifts that we had for our grandkids and we have a granddaughter and my wife bought this, what do you call it, the house, you know this stuff, the big, you know, that big one and we gave it to her at our house. She couldn't wait to get to her house so she could open it up and set it up and her mother sent me a picture of her, with her big, you know, I'm talking about that big though. There she had already unwrapped it. Her name had been on it so it was hers. She unwrapped it because it was hers. She took possession of it. It was hers, she appropriated it. It was hers, she began to enjoy the blessings because it was hers. She opened the gift and she appropriated the gift and she started enjoying the pleasure of that gift. What good would the gift have been if she never realized it was hers? What good would it have been if she hadn't taken off all of that wrappings? Amen, do you understand the point I'm making? You ought to learn from my granddaughter Anna to take Jesus very personally. Amen? So unwrap him so that you understand what you have. How much is actually in that box? I said her mother says she didn't know it was that big. So she was surprised when it was taken out of the box and it was that big. May God surprise you. You not hear me. May God surprise you. I'm challenging you this Christmas to receive the gifts I was announced by the angel. Receive the gift. Thank God it's the whole world, but please understand that you too, amen? And that your gift must be so personal. Your name was on that gift that the angel was speaking of. If the shepherds had their name on it, then your name is on that gift and you ought to take Jesus, oh my goodness, you ought to take Jesus and you ought to give God some praise. You ought to take Jesus and you ought to thank him. You ought to take Jesus and you ought to celebrate him today because your name is on that gift unwrap him. And you have help. Anna's mother helps her to unwrap the gift. God has sent the Holy Spirit. God has given you pastors. God has given you one another. Take advantage of what God has provided to help you unwrap the gifts of Christ so that you can truly see what you have. And I guarantee you that you will be happy and I guarantee you the great of the revelation of who he is, the great of your joy will be. If you are a child of God and you have no joy it's because you haven't unwrapped the gift. So you're not experiencing the joy that the gift gives. Raise your hand as the Holy Spirit. Help me to unwrap the gift called Jesus. Until you is born this day in the city of David it's saved you are born this day in the city of David. Two things. One, our faith is not based on a myth. Our faith is not based on fables. Our faith is not based on abstract principles. Our faith is not based on human philosophy. Our faith is rooted in history. I'm not preaching Jesus because somebody had a dream. We're not gathered here today because somebody had a vision. We're gathered here today because on a certain day in history a baby was born. Are you hear me doing a certain time in history that the reign of King Augustus a baby was born? Are you hear me in a certain particular city in Bethlehem? A baby was born. Shepherds went and saw him that night. A baby was born and visited by shepherds. Are you hear me? That same baby grew up in Nazareth, history. Are you hear me? He walked the streets of Israel for 33 years. He lived and walked the streets of Israel. He was a carpenter's son. And then at a Star Trek God released him to fulfill his destiny. And in three years he operated working miracle signs and wonders raising the dead, multiplying five loaths and two fish. Are you hear me speaking to the winds and speaking to the waves and the waves obey him? Then they arrested him and they crucified him and he died. But before he died, he said, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And then he said, my God, I commit myself into your hands. He died. But on the third day he arose from the dead. This is not a favor. There were eyewitnesses to the information. There were women who saw the empty grave. There were women who heard the angels and saw the angel. There were disciples who were afraid, but into whom he appeared. And he said to one of them here, don't doubt. Touch me, feed me. Oh, it is I. Are you listening to me? This is history, folks. This is history. This baby I'm talking about, this story I'm talking about, this gift I'm talking about, it's real. I said it's real. I'm not asking you to pretend it's real. It's real. It's real. He was born unto you for your benefit, for your good on your behalf, because God was singing about you. This child was born for you and for me. Say thank God, it is history, story. I'm not worshiping my imagination. I didn't come up with some thoughts and ideas to help me make it, to be a crutch that can help me just cope. No, this is real. Is it a crutch? But it's a real one. It's not one that I imagine. It's one that God provided. I needed a crutch, and he gave me one. Raise your hands and say thank God Jesus is a real Savior. The news of his birth brought joy to the shepherds. The news of his birth brings joy to us who believe. Until you is born this day, I like that. The day, I like that. Christ, the angel said was born that day. Why does that matter? It matters because this boy who was born that day was announced 5,000 years or more early in the book of Genesis. In the book of Genesis was the first time on Garcete of the Table. You know, the seed of the woman is going to be born and he is going to crush your head. God was saying he will come. And therefore around 5,000 years, the prophets kept saying he will come. He will come. In Genesis, he will come. In Exodus, he will come. In Leviticus, he will come. In Numbers, he will come. Throughout the prophets, he will come. In Isaiah, he will come. In Jeremiah, he will come. All the way to America, he will come. And so from Genesis to Malachi, almost around 5,000 years using the theological measurement of time in relative to history. But then there was silence because from the time of Malachi to the time of Luke, 400 years, silence. No prophets speaking on behalf of God, no public pronouncement. All they had to go on now was what he had said. And so for 5,000 years, he will come. There are 400 years, but that didn't change anything. He was still going to come. Now you just don't know when, but he's coming. He's coming, he's coming, he's coming. And then all of a sudden, he will come, changes. And then on that night, the angel appears. What I mean, he who was coming is, or hallelujah, and then he who was coming is come. The word is fulfilled. The prophecy has come to pass. What God said he would do, God has done. 5,000 plus years, God has fulfilled the word. He spoke 5,000 years ago. So, the letter, 400 or so prophecies, 4 fails to the letter. At the fullness of time, God brings the past, the word that he has spoken. Now, why does that matter? It matters because it's me, God will always, God will always keep his word. And me is that it may seem like he's forgotten, but he has not. You need to hear me because God spoke to some of you. He spoke to you from the scriptures. He spoke to you by the spirit. It wasn't your imagination. You heard from God. And there was a time there when God seemed to be continuing to hear it, then silence. And it's been a while and you haven't heard anything recent that it doesn't look like God is keeping his promise. It may seem that he has forgotten, maybe he changed his mind, because it didn't like the way you were living. Maybe he's not going to do it. And if you're not here for doing those years of silence, you can start to doubt what God has said. And you can start to question the faithfulness of God. Here I mean today, I declare unto you, no word of God is void of power. And no word of God will return void. Has he said it? Will he not do it? Has he said it? Will he not do it? Has he said it? Will he not do it? Unless it was not he that spoke, but if he was the one that spoke, then hear me. There may be silence and everything may seem like, God isn't keeping his promise. Let this story encourage you. Let this story strengthen you. Let this story build your faith. No word of God will return to him void. It is impossible. It is impossible for the word that God speaks not to come to pass. It is a very nature of the word. It comes to pass. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? And if you're not hearing a fresh word for the Lord, that means you got something that is already written. Go back and remind yourself of what is written. Take the scriptures and remind yourself of the prophets. Take the scriptures and remind yourself of what it means that answer you is born this day. It's saviour which is Christ the Lord. Say hallelujah. Because that word remains true. 1,000 years later, it remains true. 2,000 years later, 3,000 years later, 4,000 years later, 5,000 years later, that word will never change. It was true in the book of Genesis and it's true in Luke. It was true in Luke and it's true in 2025. In my life and in your life, listen to me on this day. You say, I love the angel said this day. Because you see, our God is a this day God. Listen to me. I know God did things yesterday. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yesterday, he put in the recipe. Yesterday, he fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fish. Yesterday, he healed the leopard. He opened the blind eyes. Yesterday, he heard your prayer. Yesterday, he worked a miracle for you. Five years ago, seven years, I thank God he's in my past. I can look at yesterday and I can see the evidence that God is true. His word comes to pass. I can also look at tomorrow. And I can say, you know what? I know tomorrow God has some things for me. Tomorrow God will manifest in this way. Tomorrow God will do this. And tomorrow Jesus is coming back for me. Amen. I can look at tomorrow and thank God that there's some things in my tomorrow's that will come to pass. But I want you to hear today. And I believe this is why God wanted them to hear. And God wants you to hear. Your God, my God, is not just the God at yesterday. So you don't have to keep looking back at what he did. And he's not just the God of tomorrow. Well, the only thing that keeps you worshiping is what he will do tomorrow. I want you to understand that this thing, come on, say God, this thing is a savior. This thing is a Christ. This thing is the Lord. God, this thing, you are starting prayer. This thing, you are working miracles. This thing, you are giving me breakthroughs. This thing, you are guiding and ordering my steps. This thing, you're protecting me. This thing, you're preserving me. This thing, you are working in my life, in my family. This thing, you are being faithful. This thing, you are being good. This thing, you are being merciful. This thing, this thing, this thing, you are God. This thing, you are Jesus. Everybody say, does that? Say, I serve it right now, God. Are you hearing me? Say, I serve it on time, God. Amen. The prophet said he will come. The angel said, he is come. You and me can now say, you can look at your circumstances, your tests, your trials, and you can say, he has your Savior, your deliverer has come. Your God has come. Because he is Christ who is the Lord. That word, Lord, there is the same, is the translation of the Hebrew and the Greek words for God. Hear me. This day, in Christ, the gift, the giver is God. The gift is God. God has not only given you a gift. God has given you God. This day, God has given you God. And if God has given you God, then you can say this day, God has given me the answer. Because God is the answer. This day, God has given me the breakthrough. Because God is the breakthrough. This day, God has given me the healer and the healing. Because God is. This is good news, folks. Raise your hand and give God some praise. Holy Spirit, let them see it. Let them grasp it. Hallelujah. Have you received the gift? Have you appropriated the gift? Have you appreciated the gift? What will you do with this good news? What will you know, do with this gift? The shepherds believed it. The shepherds said, let's go and see. The shepherds acted upon it. And then the Bible says, they told what they had heard, the things they had seen, the things that have been told to them, they spoke concerning what they saw. Hear me, believe it. Hear me, act upon this. The Savior, Christ, the Lord, is yours today. Act upon it and then don't keep your mouth shut. Tell the whole world because he's not just a gift for you. He said, gift for all people. Proclaim it, tell it. Let the whole world know that unto them is born. This day is Savior, which is Christ, the Lord. Every eye closes, every hear about. You may be here today and you have already received Jesus as your Savior. I pray that this message has strengthened you and encouraged you. You heard watching that you will truly unwrap this gift so that you can be filled with the joy of salvation. I pray that you will truly see that gift that was promised in the old tent, that one who will come in the future is here right now for you. Receive him now. Receive him, the Savior. Receive him, the Lord, because it's only as Lord that he can save you. Right where you are, you can open your mouth, watching online. Join me. I'm going to lead you to pray for me to make this your own. And church has helped us pray right now. Say, Father God, today, I open my mouth to declare Jesus is my Lord. Jesus is my Savior. He is your gift of salvation. I repent of my sins. I no longer trust myself. I place my life into your hands. Christ Jesus, my Savior, and my Lord in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Let's clap onto the mold. Hallelujah to God be the glory.

**[01:38 - 01:43]** in the city of David, a savior who is Christ the Lord.

**[01:45 - 01:47]** That was the angel of the Lord

**[01:47 - 01:51]** bringing a special message to the shepherds

**[01:51 - 01:55]** while they kept watch over their sheep by night.

**[01:56 - 01:59]** Most of us should be familiar with the story.

**[01:59 - 02:01]** Luke chapter two.

**[02:02 - 02:09]** Until you is born this day in the city of David, a savior

**[02:09 - 02:14]** who is who is who Christ the Lord.

**[02:14 - 02:22]** That announcement by that angel changed history.

**[02:22 - 02:27]** Luke tells us that 2000 years ago

**[02:27 - 02:32]** in the middle of an ordinary night on a cold winter morning,

**[02:35 - 02:40]** heaven interrupted earth.

**[02:40 - 02:45]** While the world was asleep, God was awake.

**[02:48 - 02:50]** Isn't that wonderful?

**[02:50 - 02:52]** The Bible says he never sleeps,

**[02:53 - 02:56]** nor slumber, somebody needs to be encouraged by that.

**[02:57 - 03:00]** Hey, man, your God isn't sleeping.

**[03:01 - 03:06]** Your God knows where you are.

**[03:06 - 03:11]** If you are on a field at night

**[03:11 - 03:14]** on a cold winter morning today,

**[03:16 - 03:22]** know this, he knows where you are.

**[03:22 - 03:23]** No, he's not sleeping.

**[03:25 - 03:30]** But on this particular day, heaven interrupted earth

**[03:31 - 03:33]** and this announcement was made by the angel

**[03:33 - 03:35]** that changed everything.

**[03:35 - 03:40]** City and neighbor, it changed everything.

**[03:40 - 03:41]** Hallelujah.

**[03:41 - 03:44]** The angel said to the shepherds,

**[03:44 - 03:48]** I bring you good news.

**[03:49 - 03:54]** Hey, man, of glad tidings of great joy

**[03:55 - 03:56]** that would be to all people.

**[03:56 - 04:00]** I have a question for you, is it still good news?

**[04:01 - 04:07]** Is it good news for you?

**[04:07 - 04:13]** If he came for you, I want you to say he came for me.

**[04:13 - 04:16]** City and neighbor, that is good news.

**[04:17 - 04:22]** I want you to take note of the scene that night.

**[04:23 - 04:28]** The angel came, made the most important announcement

**[04:28 - 04:29]** in history.

**[04:30 - 04:35]** But the announcement was not made in a king's palace.

**[04:37 - 04:41]** The announcement was not made in a beautiful temple.

**[04:42 - 04:45]** This most important announcement in church history

**[04:45 - 04:50]** took place in a quiet field at midnight.

**[04:51 - 04:55]** So God is so different.

**[04:55 - 04:59]** They've got to help us to think and interpret

**[04:59 - 05:04]** and understand the way he does.

**[05:05 - 05:07]** Because if it had been you or me,

**[05:07 - 05:11]** we would have had microphones.

**[05:11 - 05:15]** We would have had to press.

**[05:15 - 05:18]** Hey, man, the reporters from the Jerusalem post

**[05:19 - 05:20]** would have been there.

**[05:21 - 05:24]** But that night when the most important announcement ever made

**[05:24 - 05:28]** that church history was announced by an angel

**[05:28 - 05:31]** and then angels, there were no microphones,

**[05:31 - 05:38]** no headlines, no reporters, just shepherds,

**[05:38 - 05:41]** say just shepherds.

**[05:41 - 05:44]** Now, if you know anything about shepherds in that day,

**[05:44 - 05:48]** they were not importing people.

**[05:48 - 05:50]** They were not respected.

**[05:51 - 05:54]** They were never invited to anything.

**[05:55 - 05:57]** They were considered really unclean.

**[05:59 - 06:01]** And on the socio-economic ladder,

**[06:01 - 06:06]** they were at the lowest.

**[06:06 - 06:08]** They did not live in nice houses,

**[06:08 - 06:12]** they did not wear nice clothes.

**[06:12 - 06:17]** Yet that night into determining who he would

**[06:18 - 06:21]** send this most important message to.

**[06:22 - 06:27]** God decided I'm gonna send them to shepherds.

**[06:29 - 06:30]** Say hallelujah.

**[06:32 - 06:34]** Now think about it.

**[06:34 - 06:38]** I'm gonna send them to shepherds.

**[06:39 - 06:44]** Who are keeping watch over sheep in the field?

**[06:47 - 06:49]** People who have been excluded,

**[06:50 - 06:52]** people who are looked down upon,

**[06:53 - 06:56]** people who are treated as though they do not matter.

**[06:58 - 07:00]** Those who the world had rejected

**[07:02 - 07:06]** are the ones that God chose.

**[07:06 - 07:08]** I don't know how you see yourself

**[07:09 - 07:12]** and what you feel about who you are.

**[07:12 - 07:14]** But let me just make two applications here.

**[07:14 - 07:18]** First, never think you're better than someone

**[07:19 - 07:21]** because you've got education.

**[07:23 - 07:25]** Never think you're better than someone

**[07:25 - 07:28]** because you have a position with a title.

**[07:29 - 07:32]** You've got a title before your name.

**[07:33 - 07:40]** President, vice president, director, doctor.

**[07:41 - 07:43]** Reverend, and on and on.

**[07:43 - 07:48]** Don't think CEO that you are better than anyone

**[07:51 - 07:54]** just because of a position you occupy

**[07:54 - 07:57]** the level of education you have, the car you drive,

**[07:59 - 08:03]** the house you live and the clothes you wear.

**[08:03 - 08:06]** And don't ever make the mistake of thinking

**[08:06 - 08:10]** that God thinks that you're better than anyone

**[08:11 - 08:12]** because of those titles.

**[08:12 - 08:15]** That night he sent the angels

**[08:15 - 08:21]** with the most important message to shepherds.

**[08:21 - 08:26]** Don't make that mistake.

**[08:26 - 08:27]** And don't make the other mistake.

**[08:28 - 08:34]** Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are inferior

**[08:34 - 08:40]** to anyone because you don't have the title

**[08:40 - 08:42]** before your name or the letters after your name.

**[08:42 - 08:45]** You don't have the house, you don't have the car,

**[08:45 - 08:47]** you don't have the Louis Vuitton,

**[08:47 - 08:49]** you don't have the whatever.

**[08:50 - 08:55]** Never look at someone and determine who you are

**[08:56 - 09:00]** and your value based upon those types of things.

**[09:01 - 09:06]** Remember that night God sent his angels

**[09:06 - 09:11]** not to the kings, not to those who were celebrated

**[09:11 - 09:16]** by men as being big and important people in God's eyes.

**[09:16 - 09:20]** Those shepherds were just as important

**[09:20 - 09:25]** and just as valuable had the same amount of value

**[09:26 - 09:27]** and worth in his eyes.

**[09:27 - 09:32]** He loved them just as much as he loved every other person,

**[09:32 - 09:39]** regardless of their outward accomplishments.

**[09:39 - 09:41]** So don't make the mistake.

**[09:41 - 09:45]** Give respect to people who to whom respect is you

**[09:45 - 09:48]** but don't ever feel that you're inferior

**[09:48 - 09:52]** to anybody that you love less or that worth as much.

**[09:52 - 09:56]** Never feel you have to bow your head because you're not equal

**[09:56 - 10:00]** and you can't look at someone's face.

**[10:00 - 10:04]** Now I'm not saying disregard your traditions at home.

**[10:04 - 10:07]** I'm just saying do allow yourself to think that you are.

**[10:07 - 10:09]** So you're inferior to someone else.

**[10:09 - 10:12]** Therefore, you cannot look at them face to face

**[10:12 - 10:15]** because of some type of position of wealth.

**[10:15 - 10:19]** God doesn't value you in that way.

**[10:20 - 10:22]** So if you have been one of those

**[10:22 - 10:24]** who have been looking down upon yourselves

**[10:24 - 10:26]** and thinking you're not worthy because you know this,

**[10:26 - 10:28]** you keep comparing yourself with other people

**[10:28 - 10:30]** and making yourself feel so bad,

**[10:31 - 10:37]** hear the good news today, unto you.

**[10:37 - 10:40]** Say unto you, amen.

**[10:40 - 10:43]** So therefore you can stand straight, you can lift up your head

**[10:43 - 10:46]** and you can be willing to look at any man in the face

**[10:46 - 10:49]** and say God loves me, I am as valuable as you.

**[10:50 - 10:54]** God has a purpose, God has a plan for me

**[10:54 - 10:58]** that is as important to him as any plan he has

**[10:58 - 11:00]** for anybody else.

**[11:00 - 11:01]** Are you hear me?

**[11:01 - 11:05]** Stop excluding yourself because men exclude you.

**[11:06 - 11:10]** Stop letting the opinions of men be what determine who you are

**[11:10 - 11:11]** and how you see yourself.

**[11:11 - 11:14]** Stop trying so hard.

**[11:14 - 11:19]** So impress men, it doesn't matter.

**[11:19 - 11:23]** Hey man, it meant some of you are not resting.

**[11:23 - 11:25]** You are working and working and working

**[11:25 - 11:27]** and the only thing that has you to do all of that

**[11:27 - 11:32]** is because you want to impress men.

**[11:32 - 11:34]** You want to look good in the eyes of men

**[11:34 - 11:37]** because I'm telling men say they like you,

**[11:37 - 11:38]** you can't like yourself.

**[11:40 - 11:42]** I've come to tell you God likes you.

**[11:43 - 11:44]** I've come to tell you this morning,

**[11:44 - 11:46]** this story says God loves you.

**[11:46 - 11:47]** That you're important.

**[11:47 - 11:51]** Are you hear me say I am somebody

**[11:52 - 11:57]** because I am God's amen.

**[12:00 - 12:03]** So that night the angel came into the field

**[12:03 - 12:08]** where the shepherds were.

**[12:08 - 12:13]** I placed that society would reject.

**[12:13 - 12:16]** That's where God came.

**[12:16 - 12:21]** And if God came there to meet them,

**[12:22 - 12:24]** God will come where you are.

**[12:26 - 12:27]** Wherever you are.

**[12:27 - 12:33]** And when God shows up where you are, where you are becomes.

**[12:33 - 12:38]** I hear me the most important place,

**[12:38 - 12:40]** the most holy place,

**[12:41 - 12:44]** the most exalted place

**[12:44 - 12:48]** because when God is there, his presence

**[12:48 - 12:56]** makes everything exalted.

**[12:56 - 12:58]** All right, turn to the person next to you

**[12:59 - 13:03]** and say, did you hear what Bishop just said?

**[13:03 - 13:07]** Are you a believer?

**[13:07 - 13:10]** Say you're the temple of the Holy Ghost.

**[13:10 - 13:12]** God moved into you.

**[13:13 - 13:15]** God lives in you.

**[13:16 - 13:19]** That makes you an exalted place.

**[13:20 - 13:24]** Say hallelujah.

**[13:24 - 13:27]** Now when the angel appeared,

**[13:27 - 13:29]** the Bible says the shepherds responded

**[13:29 - 13:32]** and the way they responded was to be afraid.

**[13:32 - 13:33]** They were afraid.

**[13:34 - 13:38]** Unfortunately, that response is far too common.

**[13:39 - 13:43]** Two million people respond to God

**[13:43 - 13:47]** as though he's somebody to be afraid of.

**[13:48 - 13:51]** It sounded all the way back in the book of Genesis.

**[13:51 - 13:53]** Remember, God created Adam and Eve.

**[13:53 - 13:56]** God placed them in the garden and was so beautiful.

**[13:56 - 13:58]** God provided everything for them.

**[13:58 - 14:00]** And then Adam and Eve said,

**[14:01 - 14:06]** And when God came into the garden looking for them,

**[14:06 - 14:09]** the Scripture tells us Adam and Eve were hiding.

**[14:11 - 14:16]** And when God found them the question he asked was,

**[14:16 - 14:20]** where are you and Adam said, we were afraid.

**[14:21 - 14:23]** But there was no need to be afraid.

**[14:23 - 14:25]** God already knew what they had done.

**[14:25 - 14:28]** And when he came walking in the cool of the day,

**[14:29 - 14:33]** he wasn't surprised to find out he knew what had happened.

**[14:33 - 14:38]** But he wasn't coming there that day in order to scare them.

**[14:38 - 14:43]** He was coming in order to save them.

**[14:43 - 14:47]** When the Lord put an angel or angels around the tree of light,

**[14:47 - 14:48]** it was the saved Adam and Eve

**[14:48 - 14:50]** because he didn't want them to partake of that.

**[14:50 - 14:53]** Had they partaken of the tree of light,

**[14:53 - 14:55]** they would have remained perpetually in that state

**[14:55 - 14:57]** that they had just placed themselves in.

**[14:57 - 14:59]** So when God came that day, it was to protect them.

**[15:00 - 15:02]** To preserve them.

**[15:03 - 15:06]** To provide a means of escape.

**[15:06 - 15:10]** To rescue them from the mess that they had placed themselves in.

**[15:11 - 15:14]** And so on that particular day when he came

**[15:14 - 15:17]** and he spoke to them and he spoke of what would happen,

**[15:17 - 15:17]** he put them out.

**[15:17 - 15:23]** All of that was to save them.

**[15:23 - 15:26]** But they were scared when they should have been glad.

**[15:26 - 15:27]** Instead of hiding, they should have been running

**[15:27 - 15:29]** to him so we made a mess help us

**[15:29 - 15:31]** because we can't help ourselves.

**[15:32 - 15:36]** One day Jesus came walking on the sea to the disciples.

**[15:36 - 15:37]** They were on the boat.

**[15:37 - 15:39]** There was a huge storm.

**[15:39 - 15:42]** They were afraid because the storm threatened to destroy their lives.

**[15:42 - 15:44]** And then Christ comes in the midst of the storm

**[15:44 - 15:47]** and they see him and they're afraid to think he's a ghost.

**[15:48 - 15:50]** And here the shepherds are doing the same thing.

**[15:50 - 15:52]** The angels appear.

**[15:52 - 15:55]** They're sent by God with a message for them

**[15:55 - 15:59]** and their response is to be afraid

**[15:59 - 16:01]** when really what they should have done.

**[16:01 - 16:05]** Instead of cowering in fear, instead of being terrified

**[16:05 - 16:07]** by what they saw, the sight of the angels

**[16:07 - 16:09]** should have caused them to rejoice

**[16:09 - 16:14]** because God did not send the angel to harm them.

**[16:14 - 16:18]** He sent the angel to arm them with the truth

**[16:18 - 16:21]** concerning Jesus.

**[16:21 - 16:23]** Let me repeat, there was no need for them to be afraid.

**[16:23 - 16:25]** Their response to God should have been over.

**[16:25 - 16:30]** The response to the angel should have been to be joyful,

**[16:30 - 16:32]** to be glad to see the angel

**[16:32 - 16:36]** but they were afraid because they were so conscious of their sin.

**[16:36 - 16:39]** So conscious of their wrongdoing.

**[16:39 - 16:40]** They were afraid and they thought

**[16:40 - 16:43]** that the angel was coming to bring judgment.

**[16:44 - 16:48]** And so they were scared, but God did not send the angel

**[16:48 - 16:50]** to those shepherds at night

**[16:50 - 16:51]** in order to scare them.

**[16:51 - 16:56]** He sent the angels at night in order to save them

**[16:56 - 17:01]** in order to arm them with the truth concerning Christ.

**[17:03 - 17:07]** Who had been born?

**[17:07 - 17:10]** Notice what the angel said to them?

**[17:10 - 17:17]** The angel said, be not.

**[17:17 - 17:19]** The angel didn't say, be afraid.

**[17:19 - 17:22]** The angel said, what?

**[17:22 - 17:24]** What did the angel say?

**[17:24 - 17:26]** Yeah, be not afraid.

**[17:26 - 17:27]** Fear not.

**[17:28 - 17:29]** Why?

**[17:29 - 17:31]** Because he wasn't bringing bad news.

**[17:31 - 17:33]** He was bringing good news.

**[17:33 - 17:36]** I've brought this day to you.

**[17:36 - 17:39]** Good news that were produced.

**[17:40 - 17:41]** Produced what?

**[17:41 - 17:43]** Great joy.

**[17:43 - 17:47]** Good news that produces great joy.

**[17:47 - 17:48]** That's the gospel.

**[17:49 - 17:54]** The gospel we proclaim concerning Jesus is always good news.

**[17:56 - 17:59]** And when people hear the good news,

**[17:59 - 18:01]** and I hope you're hearing the good news

**[18:01 - 18:03]** and you will continue to hear the good news in this world.

**[18:03 - 18:05]** There's so much bad news.

**[18:06 - 18:10]** CNN and Fox and MS now.

**[18:10 - 18:13]** And wherever you turn, it's not the good news.

**[18:13 - 18:16]** They focus on as always the bad news.

**[18:16 - 18:18]** We need to hear good news.

**[18:18 - 18:20]** And thank God we as believers,

**[18:20 - 18:24]** we who are in this church have good news.

**[18:24 - 18:26]** Are you hear me?

**[18:26 - 18:28]** Good news that if we would pay attention to

**[18:28 - 18:32]** and keep listening to, we'll produce great joy.

**[18:32 - 18:33]** Say, Hallelujah.

**[18:33 - 18:35]** How many of you want some joy today?

**[18:35 - 18:36]** Then I bring you good news.

**[18:36 - 18:40]** Until you this day is born.

**[18:40 - 18:43]** A savior who is.

**[18:44 - 18:46]** Oh, you don't sound like you believe it.

**[18:46 - 18:48]** You don't sound like you believe it.

**[18:48 - 18:50]** Say, say to the person next to you.

**[18:50 - 18:51]** Until you.

**[18:52 - 18:55]** It's born this day.

**[18:56 - 18:57]** A savior.

**[18:59 - 19:00]** Hallelujah.

**[19:00 - 19:05]** A savior who brings great joy.

**[19:10 - 19:12]** Have you contemplated him lately?

**[19:14 - 19:17]** Have you spent enough time meditating upon who he is

**[19:17 - 19:20]** and what he has done

**[19:20 - 19:22]** and what he has brought?

**[19:22 - 19:26]** Have you considered why the news of his birth

**[19:26 - 19:31]** produces such great joy and is such good news?

**[19:32 - 19:35]** For all people.

**[19:35 - 19:39]** Now that night, the angel, again,

**[19:39 - 19:42]** knowing who they were speaking to,

**[19:43 - 19:46]** understanding that these were shepherds

**[19:46 - 19:48]** who had always been excluded

**[19:49 - 19:52]** and who had always been put down

**[19:52 - 19:54]** and as a result,

**[19:55 - 19:58]** would themselves by their own thinking

**[19:58 - 20:02]** exclude themselves from anything special.

**[20:02 - 20:04]** As you see, when you've been put down and put down

**[20:04 - 20:05]** and put down all your life,

**[20:05 - 20:07]** it seems like people have been putting you down.

**[20:07 - 20:09]** And when the opinions of people matter to you

**[20:09 - 20:11]** and matter to you,

**[20:11 - 20:13]** you can get to the point where you actually are controlled

**[20:13 - 20:15]** in your mind by those thoughts

**[20:15 - 20:16]** and you become your horse enemy.

**[20:16 - 20:19]** You become your number one critic.

**[20:19 - 20:22]** You agree with them more than they themselves are intending

**[20:22 - 20:25]** because you have, you have,

**[20:25 - 20:27]** it imbibed, you have,

**[20:27 - 20:29]** you have taken into yourself.

**[20:29 - 20:32]** There, there, there were a succession degree

**[20:32 - 20:35]** that you now are excluding yourself.

**[20:35 - 20:36]** And so hear me, guys,

**[20:36 - 20:39]** if the angels had only said that night,

**[20:39 - 20:44]** we bring you good news of great joy

**[20:44 - 20:46]** which shall be to all people.

**[20:46 - 20:48]** If the angels had stopped there,

**[20:48 - 20:50]** those shepherds would not have included themselves

**[20:50 - 20:53]** in that group.

**[20:53 - 20:55]** That this message was centered.

**[20:55 - 20:57]** They would have said to all people,

**[20:57 - 20:59]** but they would not have seen themselves

**[20:59 - 21:03]** as a part of it.

**[21:03 - 21:04]** Their promises God makes,

**[21:04 - 21:11]** and some of you don't see yourself as included.

**[21:11 - 21:13]** For God to love the world and you question

**[21:13 - 21:17]** when a God loves you.

**[21:17 - 21:20]** I hear me, there are many promises that God makes

**[21:20 - 21:22]** and he makes all of his children,

**[21:22 - 21:24]** but there is a huge bunch of us

**[21:24 - 21:27]** who are not able to see ourselves walking

**[21:27 - 21:29]** in the fulfillment of those promises

**[21:29 - 21:31]** because for some reason

**[21:31 - 21:34]** we don't believe the promise applies to us

**[21:34 - 21:36]** because we're not looking at the giver,

**[21:36 - 21:37]** we're looking at ourselves.

**[21:39 - 21:40]** And we just qualify ourselves

**[21:40 - 21:45]** for that which God has given to us.

**[21:45 - 21:50]** I am preaching better than you listening.

**[21:50 - 21:53]** Hear me, if the angels had only said,

**[21:53 - 21:55]** this is good news for all people,

**[21:55 - 21:57]** they shepherds would have been there

**[21:57 - 22:01]** and said, oh, I wish I was part of that group.

**[22:02 - 22:03]** They would have excluded themselves.

**[22:03 - 22:06]** That is why God made sure

**[22:06 - 22:07]** that the angels said to them,

**[22:07 - 22:09]** that it is three words,

**[22:09 - 22:15]** four, I'm two, you.

**[22:15 - 22:18]** Good news for all people.

**[22:18 - 22:22]** And by the way, that includes you shepherds.

**[22:22 - 22:27]** Good news for all people and all people means you.

**[22:28 - 22:33]** God was to know that he had you two on his mind

**[22:33 - 22:36]** when he decided to do what he just did.

**[22:38 - 22:40]** Are you hearing me?

**[22:40 - 22:45]** God wanted to say to them, you are included.

**[22:45 - 22:50]** In what I'm doing, do not exclude yourself

**[22:50 - 22:54]** based upon how you have felt about yourself

**[22:54 - 22:57]** or based upon what you have heard about yourself

**[22:57 - 23:00]** based upon your evaluation of yourself,

**[23:00 - 23:03]** based upon your comparison with others,

**[23:03 - 23:06]** do not exclude yourself

**[23:06 - 23:11]** because this good news is for you shepherds too.

**[23:16 - 23:21]** I'm gonna say here, because somebody needs to know

**[23:22 - 23:28]** that Jesus died for you too.

**[23:28 - 23:33]** Somebody needs to know that a savior was born for you too.

**[23:38 - 23:41]** Somebody needs to know that this gift

**[23:41 - 23:45]** that is being offered the whole world

**[23:45 - 23:48]** has your name on it.

**[23:49 - 23:54]** Jesus is the gift from God to all people,

**[23:55 - 24:00]** but he's also God's gift to me.

**[24:01 - 24:07]** Oh God, help me to help somebody to hear this.

**[24:07 - 24:10]** I don't know how many of you got Christmas gifts.

**[24:10 - 24:12]** I didn't know and I got one or two.

**[24:14 - 24:19]** Amen, but it had my name on it.

**[24:19 - 24:21]** We had gifts that we had for our grandkids

**[24:21 - 24:23]** and we have a granddaughter

**[24:23 - 24:27]** and my wife bought this, what do you call it,

**[24:27 - 24:30]** the house, you know this stuff, the big, you know,

**[24:30 - 24:35]** that big one and we gave it to her at our house.

**[24:35 - 24:37]** She couldn't wait to get to her house

**[24:37 - 24:40]** so she could open it up and set it up

**[24:40 - 24:43]** and her mother sent me a picture of her,

**[24:44 - 24:48]** with her big, you know, I'm talking about that big though.

**[24:48 - 24:54]** There she had already unwrapped it.

**[24:54 - 24:57]** Her name had been on it so it was hers.

**[24:57 - 25:00]** She unwrapped it because it was hers.

**[25:00 - 25:02]** She took possession of it.

**[25:02 - 25:04]** It was hers, she appropriated it.

**[25:04 - 25:08]** It was hers, she began to enjoy the blessings

**[25:08 - 25:09]** because it was hers.

**[25:09 - 25:13]** She opened the gift and she appropriated the gift

**[25:13 - 25:19]** and she started enjoying the pleasure of that gift.

**[25:20 - 25:22]** What good would the gift have been

**[25:22 - 25:25]** if she never realized it was hers?

**[25:26 - 25:27]** What good would it have been

**[25:27 - 25:32]** if she hadn't taken off all of that wrappings?

**[25:35 - 25:38]** Amen, do you understand the point I'm making?

**[25:38 - 25:41]** You ought to learn from my granddaughter Anna

**[25:42 - 25:48]** to take Jesus very personally.

**[25:48 - 25:49]** Amen?

**[25:49 - 25:56]** So unwrap him so that you understand what you have.

**[25:58 - 26:03]** How much is actually in that box?

**[26:03 - 26:05]** I said her mother says she didn't know it was that big.

**[26:07 - 26:11]** So she was surprised when it was taken out of the box

**[26:11 - 26:11]** and it was that big.

**[26:11 - 26:13]** May God surprise you.

**[26:15 - 26:17]** You not hear me.

**[26:17 - 26:19]** May God surprise you.

**[26:19 - 26:22]** I'm challenging you this Christmas

**[26:22 - 26:26]** to receive the gifts I was announced by the angel.

**[26:26 - 26:27]** Receive the gift.

**[26:27 - 26:28]** Thank God it's the whole world,

**[26:28 - 26:33]** but please understand that you too, amen?

**[26:33 - 26:36]** And that your gift must be so personal.

**[26:36 - 26:41]** Your name was on that gift that the angel was speaking of.

**[26:42 - 26:44]** If the shepherds had their name on it,

**[26:44 - 26:46]** then your name is on that gift

**[26:46 - 26:51]** and you ought to take Jesus, oh my goodness,

**[26:51 - 26:53]** you ought to take Jesus

**[26:53 - 26:55]** and you ought to give God some praise.

**[26:55 - 26:58]** You ought to take Jesus and you ought to thank him.

**[26:58 - 27:03]** You ought to take Jesus and you ought to celebrate him today

**[27:03 - 27:08]** because your name is on that gift unwrap him.

**[27:08 - 27:12]** And you have help.

**[27:12 - 27:15]** Anna's mother helps her to unwrap the gift.

**[27:15 - 27:17]** God has sent the Holy Spirit.

**[27:17 - 27:19]** God has given you pastors.

**[27:19 - 27:24]** God has given you one another.

**[27:24 - 27:27]** Take advantage of what God has provided

**[27:27 - 27:31]** to help you unwrap the gifts of Christ

**[27:31 - 27:36]** so that you can truly see what you have.

**[27:36 - 27:40]** And I guarantee you that you will be happy

**[27:41 - 27:45]** and I guarantee you the great of the revelation of who he is,

**[27:47 - 27:52]** the great of your joy will be.

**[27:52 - 27:55]** If you are a child of God

**[27:55 - 27:56]** and you have no joy

**[27:56 - 28:03]** it's because you haven't unwrapped the gift.

**[28:03 - 28:09]** So you're not experiencing the joy that the gift gives.

**[28:09 - 28:11]** Raise your hand as the Holy Spirit.

**[28:12 - 28:17]** Help me to unwrap the gift called Jesus.

**[28:24 - 28:29]** Until you is born this day in the city of David

**[28:32 - 28:37]** it's saved you are born this day in the city of David.

**[28:38 - 28:39]** Two things.

**[28:41 - 28:46]** One, our faith is not based on a myth.

**[28:47 - 28:50]** Our faith is not based on fables.

**[28:50 - 28:55]** Our faith is not based on abstract principles.

**[28:55 - 28:59]** Our faith is not based on human philosophy.

**[28:59 - 29:05]** Our faith is rooted in history.

**[29:05 - 29:09]** I'm not preaching Jesus because somebody had a dream.

**[29:11 - 29:14]** We're not gathered here today because somebody had a vision.

**[29:14 - 29:19]** We're gathered here today because on a certain day in history

**[29:20 - 29:25]** a baby was born.

**[29:25 - 29:28]** Are you hear me doing a certain time in history

**[29:28 - 29:32]** that the reign of King Augustus a baby was born?

**[29:34 - 29:39]** Are you hear me in a certain particular city in Bethlehem?

**[29:39 - 29:42]** A baby was born.

**[29:42 - 29:46]** Shepherds went and saw him that night.

**[29:46 - 29:50]** A baby was born and visited by shepherds.

**[29:50 - 29:51]** Are you hear me?

**[29:51 - 29:55]** That same baby grew up in Nazareth, history.

**[29:55 - 29:56]** Are you hear me?

**[29:56 - 30:00]** He walked the streets of Israel for 33 years.

**[30:00 - 30:03]** He lived and walked the streets of Israel.

**[30:03 - 30:05]** He was a carpenter's son.

**[30:05 - 30:09]** And then at a Star Trek God released him to fulfill his destiny.

**[30:09 - 30:12]** And in three years he operated working miracle signs

**[30:12 - 30:17]** and wonders raising the dead, multiplying five loaths and two fish.

**[30:17 - 30:19]** Are you hear me speaking to the winds

**[30:19 - 30:22]** and speaking to the waves and the waves obey him?

**[30:22 - 30:26]** Then they arrested him and they crucified him and he died.

**[30:26 - 30:29]** But before he died, he said, my God, my God,

**[30:29 - 30:31]** why have you forsaken me?

**[30:31 - 30:34]** And then he said, my God, I commit myself into your hands.

**[30:34 - 30:35]** He died.

**[30:35 - 30:39]** But on the third day he arose from the dead.

**[30:39 - 30:40]** This is not a favor.

**[30:40 - 30:44]** There were eyewitnesses to the information.

**[30:44 - 30:46]** There were women who saw the empty grave.

**[30:46 - 30:48]** There were women who heard the angels

**[30:48 - 30:50]** and saw the angel.

**[30:50 - 30:52]** There were disciples who were afraid,

**[30:52 - 30:54]** but into whom he appeared.

**[30:54 - 30:56]** And he said to one of them here, don't doubt.

**[30:56 - 30:58]** Touch me, feed me.

**[30:58 - 30:59]** Oh, it is I.

**[30:59 - 31:00]** Are you listening to me?

**[31:00 - 31:02]** This is history, folks.

**[31:04 - 31:06]** This is history.

**[31:06 - 31:09]** This baby I'm talking about, this story I'm talking about,

**[31:09 - 31:11]** this gift I'm talking about, it's real.

**[31:12 - 31:16]** I said it's real.

**[31:16 - 31:20]** I'm not asking you to pretend it's real.

**[31:20 - 31:20]** It's real.

**[31:22 - 31:24]** It's real.

**[31:24 - 31:29]** He was born unto you for your benefit,

**[31:29 - 31:31]** for your good on your behalf,

**[31:31 - 31:34]** because God was singing about you.

**[31:34 - 31:38]** This child was born for you and for me.

**[31:38 - 31:43]** Say thank God, it is history, story.

**[31:53 - 31:57]** I'm not worshiping my imagination.

**[31:57 - 32:01]** I didn't come up with some thoughts and ideas

**[32:01 - 32:05]** to help me make it, to be a crutch

**[32:05 - 32:06]** that can help me just cope.

**[32:06 - 32:11]** No, this is real.

**[32:11 - 32:13]** Is it a crutch?

**[32:13 - 32:14]** But it's a real one.

**[32:14 - 32:16]** It's not one that I imagine.

**[32:16 - 32:18]** It's one that God provided.

**[32:18 - 32:25]** I needed a crutch, and he gave me one.

**[32:25 - 32:30]** Raise your hands and say thank God Jesus is a real Savior.

**[32:40 - 32:47]** The news of his birth brought joy to the shepherds.

**[32:47 - 32:52]** The news of his birth brings joy to us who believe.

**[32:55 - 33:00]** Until you is born this day, I like that.

**[33:01 - 33:04]** The day, I like that.

**[33:05 - 33:10]** Christ, the angel said was born that day.

**[33:12 - 33:13]** Why does that matter?

**[33:13 - 33:17]** It matters because this boy who was born that day

**[33:17 - 33:20]** was announced 5,000 years or more early

**[33:20 - 33:21]** in the book of Genesis.

**[33:22 - 33:25]** In the book of Genesis was the first time

**[33:25 - 33:26]** on Garcete of the Table.

**[33:27 - 33:31]** You know, the seed of the woman is going to be born

**[33:31 - 33:35]** and he is going to crush your head.

**[33:35 - 33:39]** God was saying he will come.

**[33:39 - 33:43]** And therefore around 5,000 years, the prophets kept saying

**[33:43 - 33:45]** he will come.

**[33:45 - 33:46]** He will come.

**[33:46 - 33:48]** In Genesis, he will come.

**[33:48 - 33:49]** In Exodus, he will come.

**[33:49 - 33:51]** In Leviticus, he will come.

**[33:51 - 33:53]** In Numbers, he will come.

**[33:53 - 33:55]** Throughout the prophets, he will come.

**[33:55 - 33:57]** In Isaiah, he will come.

**[33:57 - 33:59]** In Jeremiah, he will come.

**[33:59 - 34:02]** All the way to America, he will come.

**[34:04 - 34:09]** And so from Genesis to Malachi, almost around 5,000 years

**[34:09 - 34:13]** using the theological measurement of time

**[34:13 - 34:15]** in relative to history.

**[34:15 - 34:20]** But then there was silence because from the time

**[34:20 - 34:25]** of Malachi to the time of Luke, 400 years, silence.

**[34:26 - 34:30]** No prophets speaking on behalf of God,

**[34:30 - 34:32]** no public pronouncement.

**[34:32 - 34:37]** All they had to go on now was what he had said.

**[34:37 - 34:43]** And so for 5,000 years, he will come.

**[34:43 - 34:49]** There are 400 years, but that didn't change anything.

**[34:49 - 34:50]** He was still going to come.

**[34:50 - 34:53]** Now you just don't know when, but he's coming.

**[34:53 - 34:54]** He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

**[34:54 - 34:58]** And then all of a sudden, he will come, changes.

**[34:58 - 35:03]** And then on that night, the angel appears.

**[35:03 - 35:05]** What I mean, he who was coming is,

**[35:05 - 35:10]** or hallelujah, and then he who was coming is come.

**[35:11 - 35:14]** The word is fulfilled.

**[35:14 - 35:16]** The prophecy has come to pass.

**[35:16 - 35:20]** What God said he would do, God has done.

**[35:20 - 35:24]** 5,000 plus years, God has fulfilled the word.

**[35:24 - 35:28]** He spoke 5,000 years ago.

**[35:28 - 35:33]** So, the letter, 400 or so prophecies,

**[35:33 - 35:35]** 4 fails to the letter.

**[35:35 - 35:39]** At the fullness of time, God brings the past,

**[35:39 - 35:44]** the word that he has spoken.

**[35:44 - 35:45]** Now, why does that matter?

**[35:45 - 35:53]** It matters because it's me, God will always,

**[35:53 - 36:01]** God will always keep his word.

**[36:01 - 36:06]** And me is that it may seem like he's forgotten,

**[36:08 - 36:10]** but he has not.

**[36:10 - 36:12]** You need to hear me because God spoke to some of you.

**[36:13 - 36:15]** He spoke to you from the scriptures.

**[36:15 - 36:17]** He spoke to you by the spirit.

**[36:17 - 36:18]** It wasn't your imagination.

**[36:18 - 36:20]** You heard from God.

**[36:20 - 36:22]** And there was a time there when God seemed

**[36:22 - 36:25]** to be continuing to hear it, then silence.

**[36:26 - 36:30]** And it's been a while and you haven't heard anything recent

**[36:30 - 36:33]** that it doesn't look like God is keeping his promise.

**[36:33 - 36:35]** It may seem that he has forgotten,

**[36:35 - 36:37]** maybe he changed his mind,

**[36:37 - 36:38]** because it didn't like the way you were living.

**[36:38 - 36:40]** Maybe he's not going to do it.

**[36:40 - 36:44]** And if you're not here for doing those years of silence,

**[36:44 - 36:49]** you can start to doubt what God has said.

**[36:49 - 36:52]** And you can start to question the faithfulness of God.

**[36:52 - 36:56]** Here I mean today, I declare unto you,

**[36:56 - 37:00]** no word of God is void of power.

**[37:00 - 37:03]** And no word of God will return void.

**[37:03 - 37:05]** Has he said it?

**[37:05 - 37:07]** Will he not do it?

**[37:07 - 37:09]** Has he said it?

**[37:09 - 37:10]** Will he not do it?

**[37:10 - 37:12]** Has he said it?

**[37:12 - 37:19]** Will he not do it?

**[37:19 - 37:21]** Unless it was not he that spoke,

**[37:21 - 37:23]** but if he was the one that spoke,

**[37:23 - 37:25]** then hear me.

**[37:25 - 37:29]** There may be silence and everything may seem like,

**[37:29 - 37:32]** God isn't keeping his promise.

**[37:32 - 37:36]** Let this story encourage you.

**[37:36 - 37:38]** Let this story strengthen you.

**[37:38 - 37:41]** Let this story build your faith.

**[37:41 - 37:46]** No word of God will return to him void.

**[37:46 - 37:48]** It is impossible.

**[37:48 - 37:54]** It is impossible for the word that God speaks not to come to pass.

**[37:54 - 37:57]** It is a very nature of the word.

**[37:57 - 38:01]** It comes to pass.

**[38:01 - 38:03]** Did you hear me?

**[38:03 - 38:04]** Did you hear me?

**[38:04 - 38:07]** And if you're not hearing a fresh word for the Lord,

**[38:07 - 38:10]** that means you got something that is already written.

**[38:10 - 38:15]** Go back and remind yourself of what is written.

**[38:15 - 38:19]** Take the scriptures and remind yourself of the prophets.

**[38:19 - 38:22]** Take the scriptures and remind yourself of what it means

**[38:22 - 38:25]** that answer you is born this day.

**[38:25 - 38:27]** It's saviour which is Christ the Lord.

**[38:27 - 38:30]** Say hallelujah.

**[38:30 - 38:33]** Because that word remains true.

**[38:33 - 38:36]** 1,000 years later, it remains true.

**[38:36 - 38:42]** 2,000 years later, 3,000 years later, 4,000 years later,

**[38:42 - 38:45]** 5,000 years later, that word will never change.

**[38:45 - 38:50]** It was true in the book of Genesis and it's true in Luke.

**[38:50 - 38:54]** It was true in Luke and it's true in 2025.

**[38:54 - 38:58]** In my life and in your life,

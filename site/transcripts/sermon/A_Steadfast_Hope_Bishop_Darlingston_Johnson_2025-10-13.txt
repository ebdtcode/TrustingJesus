Amen. Father, we thank you for the Holy Spirit who is the
teacher. We gave you praise in Jesus' name. Amen. In Romans chapter 5, we started a series
from Romans chapter 5, a number of weeks now. And we were establishing from chapter 5 verse
1 to verse 5. Three treasures, we call it of our salvation. Three treasures of redemption.
And we have said that one of those treasures has revealed in Romans chapter 5 from 1 to 5
is peace with God. Okay, I have to resist the temptation to review because if I try reviewing,
I will not even get to where I need to be. But we have spoken about peace with God. And the good
thing about it is that you can go to YouTube and you can subscribe to our YouTube page and you
can hear these sermons. So you can go and hear it again. Or if you've never heard it, you can
hear it here for the first time. But we need to be established in this wonderful gift that we
have received through salvation, which is peace with God. Say, I have peace with God. They met,
the war has ended. Normal bombs are falling. We have peace with God. And then we also said,
according to Romans chapter 5, we stand in the grace of God. Amen. So the second treasure we had
is this blessing of being the recipients of the grace of God. We actually live in grace land.
We're surrounded by grace. We get up in the morning to grace. We go to work in grace.
Grace surrounds us and grace is unmerited and undeserved favor. You hear me? So one of the
benefits of salvation is that we get to enjoy continually unmerited and undeserved favor from the
Father. Never take that for granted. Amen. Raise your hand and say, thank you, Lord, for unmerited
and undeserved favor in Jesus name. Hallelujah. One more time. Say, thank you, Lord. This morning,
I was awakened to unmerited and undeserved favor. Say, Father, thank you. That throughout
this day, I'm going to walk in, experience nothing but your unmerited and undeserved favor.
Amen. We stand in this thing called grace, which means it's a permanent place. Amen. It doesn't come
and go, come and go. One day, God is gracious. Other day, God is angry. One day, God is gracious.
Other day, God is demanding that you pay no. One more time because I don't know. It's helping me
right now. So help me. Help me. Say, I'm standing in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I'm walking in his unmerited and undeserved favor all the time. So no matter what else you see,
remind yourself that this is what you receive at South Asia. Amen. And then Romans chapter 5 also
talks about hope. So let me read it. Romans chapter 5, 1 to 5. Therefore, since we have been
justified through faith, we have what peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we
have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. God of verse, God of verse 3.
And not only that, but we also, glory, really that means we rejoice. Okay. We rejoice in
tribulations. No, do we, do we jump something? I think we jump something. Go back up. Yeah.
Go back to verse 2. Yeah, there we are. I'm sorry. Through whom? Also, we have access by faith
into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Next verse.
And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulations produces perseverance
and perseverance character and character hope. Next verse. And now hope does not disappoint because
the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the spirit who was given to us. May I have some
water please. So here's the third treasure that I want to talk about today is this hope that we have.
This hope that we have because of salvation.
We have hope. Now, how important is that? You know, I just asked for water because I near water,
I was thirsty. And you know, I could go a few days without water. Maybe I say up to 40. I think
you can manage. And then you die because water is essential. Food, you can go even longer.
I think. No, I don't think you can. No, can you go 40 days without water? No.
My goodness, you can go 40 days without food. Yeah, water is a lot shorter. I'm not sure how long,
but we need water, right? And then, of course, air. You can go a few minutes.
So we know that. And nobody wants some of my water.
But what about hope? How long can you live without hope?
Can't tell you exactly how long, but I can say this. A man without hope is dead,
even though he still lives. Hope is essential for life. And the truth is, when we lose hope,
most of us at that point lose our will to live because why live? Why continue to exist?
When you have no hope, you look at the future and you see no hope. And unfortunately,
that is the reason many people do have mental breakdowns and some people go as well as committing
suicide. Hope is so essential. So where do you get your hopes from?
Proverbs chapter 13 verse 12 says, hope deferred makes the heart sick.
Where do you get your hope from? When the skies are dark, when the storms are raging,
when the bottom seems to drop out of life where can't a man find real hope? What can you anchor your
soul to? Your mind, your will and your emotions? What can you anchor your soul to? That is
steadfast and secure. I mean, most of us are familiar with the anchor and what it does for a ship.
The anchor is dropped from the ship. It hits the bottom. It's there in the anchor provides stability
for the ship in the midst of a storm. When there's a storm, there's a lot of wind and the wind
is blowing and the ship needs to be secure. It needs to be stable. Or else, it'll begin to bank
on the rocks and on boulders and sail and eventually it may actually break into pieces
fall apart, sink to the bottom of the sea. And so the anchor is used to provide stability to keep
the ship from falling apart in the midst of the storm, in the midst of the storms of life
that we all face. Do you have an anchor? What are you depending on
to secure you and keep you from falling apart? What will keep you from drifting
into despair? What will keep you from drowning in discouragement? What will keep you from
descending into depression? Because those things happen. People drift into despair. They drown
in discouragement and unfortunately some of them literally descend into deep pressure.
What keeps you? Some people, everyone has an anchor. The question is how strong is that anchor
and is the anchor able to survive the storms? Can you count on that anchor? Anchor. Some people,
their anchor is money. The bigger the savings accounts. The job, as long as they have a job and a
good job. So their hope is that their job or the money they have in the account will be able
to secure them. How many of you know that you can have all the money in the world be a multi-billionaire
and die of cancer? I mean there are just some things money is a poor anchor for. It doesn't
provide you any support. You can have all of that in fall apart.
Your anchor is the job and as long as you have that job you're okay but how many you know
that that job can disappear. So what happens if your anchor is your job and your job goes away?
Do you fall apart? The mind will in emotions. Is that when you start to descend into depression?
Because you've lost your job which was your anchor. But some of us, our anchor is somebody else
is people. It's this friend, this friend as long as this friend is in my life. She or he is going to
be there for me. And the day that person walks away your whole world, you just can't see how you
ever make it. You go into depression because that friend left or your spouse either divorces you,
cheats on you or dies. Thank God for the blessings that we have in this life. A good job is a
blessing. Having some money in your savings account as a blessing. Having a spouse, if you want
to have a spouse, is a blessing. I hear me, children are blessing and we thank God, health is a
blessing. But those things were never intended to be what you anchor your soul to.
Because there will be storms that come that none of those things can be depended upon.
We need an anchor that is step past and sure. Thank God. The Bible says we rejoice
in hope, a hope that does not make a shame. That means this is a hope that is step fast and sure. It
is a hope that is dependable. It's a hope that will survive the wind and the wave. And if your
hope is anchored in God and what God has provided for us, then ladies and gentlemen, no matter the storm
and the storms will come. You see, the anchor doesn't stop the storm. You don't need an anchor,
there's no storms. The reason you need an anchor is because storms are coming.
They're part of life, right? In this world you will have. In this world you have.
Yeah, but do what? Rejoice. Be a good chair. Rejoice. Rejoice because I, I'm already giving you a hint
in terms of who that anchor is because I, everybody say I have overcome them. So let me encourage you
as believers, as members of this church. Do not embrace these false anchors. Do not trust them
to secure your mind, your will and emotions. You need something more permanent. You need something
more reliable. You know something. You need something that will never, never fail.
Money can fail. Fail. Help can fail. People can change. Jobs can be lost. All of those things can
disappear. But thank God we have hope. And let me non-direct you to where the Bible speaks of this
hope that we have in more detail. Go to Hebrews chapter 6 from verse 13 to verse 20.
Hebrews 6 13 to 20. It's a powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, a source that we can have
as believers so that we are anchored no matter the storm. Hallelujah. Let's read it together.
For when God made a promise, when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no one
greater, he did what soar by himself. Say, surely, blessing, I will bless you and multiplying,
I will multiply you. And so after he had pasted a little door, he Abraham obtained the promise.
They promise. For men indeed swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is for them
and end of all the speed of the other words. In order to assure you that what I'm saying is true
I'm not lying, I will add I swear. Now some people say I swear it's a lie. But when you say I
swear that's supposed to mean I'm telling you the truth. All right. Okay, so I just got
determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise that immutability, that's a big word,
let's say so we can sound educated. Immutability, come on, all you educated folks, immutability. We know
English, huh? The immutability or unchangeableness of his counsel confirmed it by oath, that by
two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation
who have fled for refuge to layhold of one the hope set before us. This hope, everybody say it,
this hope, it's not just any hope. You see, you can put your hope, you can put your hope in a lot of
things and many of the things you put your hope to with enough make failing. But God is not just
talking about hope in general terms. We told you that hope is important. But when God is speaking
here, he's pointing you to a particular source of hope that will be steadfast and secure that can
keep your mind, your will and emotions regardless of what you're going through. Everybody say thank
God for this hope which we have. What do we get from? We got an association. We have it. Amen.
This hope, say this hope, we have as an anchor, so to keep my soul from drifting into the
sphere, to keep my soul from drowning in discouragement, to keep my soul from descending into depression,
we have this hope. And it's not just short, it's short and steadfast. And we just want
to enter the presence behind the veil where the foreigner has entered for us, even Jesus
haven't become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. So we have this hope.
What is this hope that we have that is before us? Well, in Romans chapter 5, when we read the
Bible says, we rejoice in hope of what the glory of God. What is this hope? The hope is a
competent expectation of future good. And now the scripture says we have every joy in this hope,
or we praise and give God glory for this hope, the hope of the glory of God. What is he talking about?
That's what he's saying. God will glorify you, no matter what you go through here,
you have been predestined to be glorified. Now what do I mean by glorification? It means
you are predestined to be conformed perfectly to the image of Jesus. You're not excited about it.
This is the hope that is said before you. And the body, no matter what you go through now,
I promise you, no matter what you go through, you're going to come out of this. And no matter what
you're going through, you are going to be completely conformed in every dimension. Your end is to be
exactly like Jesus. Now Jesus went on the cross, Jesus went into the grave, but where is Jesus now?
Where is Jesus now? Where are you going to end up? Where are you going to end up? No, just a
feel you saying that. You think the hope is there, but you haven't embraced it. And because you
haven't embraced it when you're going through problems now, you think it's the end. You think your
story is going to end on the cross. So you lose hope. You can't see beyond the cross.
Are you think your story is going to end in the tomb? So you lose hope.
But what you need to understand is that Jesus Christ hung on the cross on Friday.
Jesus Christ was in the grave on Saturday. Jesus Christ rose from the dead on Sunday.
And Jesus Christ ascended and is seated at the right hand of the Father. Everybody say hallelujah.
But that's not all. The same Bible that said Jesus was on the cross and was crucified,
said you were crucified with him.
The same Bible that says Jesus was buried in the tomb, says you were buried in the tomb when he
was buried. The same Bible that says Jesus arose, says you arose. The same Bible that says Jesus
ascended and is seated, said you ascended and you are seated with him in heavenly places far
above principalities and powers. Where are you now spiritually? Right now, where are you at the right
hand of the Father? And where will you end up when you leave this world? Your permanent position
in Christ Jesus is to be seated at the right hand of Almighty God. Don't air with Christ, air with him
ruling and raining. How long is your life? How long is your life? How long is the problem that
you're dealing with with last? temporary. I know it's hard, but it's it's it's not going to last forever.
Your problem will not last forever. But you long after your problem is gone, you are going to be
living and celebrating and rejoicing completely, totally, absolutely conform to the image of Jesus
in your spirit like Jesus in your mind like Jesus and ladies and gentlemen in your body.
When we when we were greeting people, yeah, so, so they said, why do you talk me? He's not looking.
She said, I'm looking younger, but I said, you're telling story. For those of you who don't have
your life, are you fooling me? And man, I know I'm not looking at it, but the day is coming when she
would say this and she would be absolutely telling the truth, because I would be looking like a 33
year old man, say how lay in New York forever and ever and everlasting, separate everlasting to everlasting,
forever lasting to everlasting. And I'm not talking about God. We know that about God. I'm talking
about you. For God so loved is the world that he gave his only begotten son so that who should ever
be leaves in him should not perish for half what? What do you have? How long will your problem last?
How long will you last? Say hallelujah. We had this hope and how can we be certain that it would be
just like we said? Well, we just read, when God made the promise to Abraham,
and Abraham is here as an example, so God can show you that just like I made a promise to Abraham
and then I swore. And after many years, I fulfilled it because it is impossible for me to lie.
The reason for you knowing and holding on to this hope is one because you have received a promise.
From God. And not only has God promised you that this is going to be your portion,
you're going to be like Jesus. You're even going to have to glorify bodies. You're going to be
like Jesus and you will be everlasting and everlasting life without end, like Jesus. God has not only
promised that to you. He has in addition to promising it, he has sworn.
If there was someone greater than he, he would swear about them, but there's no one greater than
he, so he saw by himself. So by myself, God, I do not only promise you glory. I do not only promise
you everlasting life by myself, I swear to you. I swear to you that one million years from now,
you will still be living. I swear to you that one billion years from now, you will still be living.
I swear to you one million years from now, you will still be living. But not like you are,
you will be living as he is. Because the Bible says, when we see him, we shall be, oh my goodness,
this is the hope of the gospel, everlasting life, but not just everlasting, existing, everlasting life,
like Jesus. Confirm to his image. That's God's purpose and that's God's promise. So we have reason,
the Bible says, for strong consolation, because our hope is not based on which to thinking,
it's not positive thinking, it's not optimism. No, this hope is based on the sore immutable promise
of God. Two immutable things. Guarantee this promise. One, God said it and God cannot lie.
Guarantee the promise. And then secondly, the God who cannot lie in addition for your benefit,
not his. I said, you know what? Just to make sure you never question or ever imagine that I will
change my mind. Concerning this, let me let you know, not only do I promise you glory.
Everlastingly so, I swear to you, that is your posture.
No matter what tribulation you face in this life,
Ibrahim in hope against hope, believe in hope, what God is saying to us, because I have promised
and I have sworn, no matter what you're going through, no matter what your mind is saying to you,
what circumstances I say, what people are saying, you remind yourself. And the Bible says,
Abraham gave glory to God instead of waiver, you lifted your voice and rejoice in the hope,
lift up your voice and begin to praise when it's going through tribulations. When you're
going through tests, he says, rejoice, which means praise, open your mouth, declare it,
say to yourself, why are I downcast? Oh my soul, remember the hope God has said before you,
why are you discouraged? Oh my soul, remember the hope that God has said before you,
why are you depressed? Oh my soul, remember the hope that God has said before you,
and which he has guaranteed by the promise and by the oath.
But there's a little bit more there. The hope is the glory. The basis for our confidence
is the promise, but more than just the promise, the basis of our confidence is the person,
the person of Christ himself. On Christ the solid, on Christ the solid rock, I stand on Christ the
solid rock. We said it's not just the promise. The promise would be enough, but it's more than
the promise. He's given the promise. He's sworn, but then also this hope, our anchor goes
into the Holy Holies, goes through the veil into the Holy Holies. The Bible says,
where Jesus, our four runner has gone. In other words, the ship, when they throw the anchor
overboard for the ship, it goes down. Our anchor goes up. The guarantee is not just based upon
the promise, it's based upon the person, because notice where Jesus, the four runner has gone.
And the reason the scripture is saying that our hope goes through the veil
into the Holy Holies, where Jesus, the four runner is gone, is because Jesus, the four runner,
is the anchor. Because I live. Because I live, you shall live also. I'm the anchor
that your hope is passing through. Jesus is the anchor. In other words, he's the one that will
keep us. And he's the one that will preserve us in the midst of the storm. And he's the one that
will keep our mind and our soul from falling apart. He is the anchor that keeps us stable
and secure in the midst of the storm. And so in the storm and when hope is being threatened,
what he is saying here, your eyes need to go up. And your eyes need to go through the veil.
It needs to find Jesus and anchor yourself to him.
Well, that doesn't excite you. I guess you don't know who this anchor is.
I guess you don't know how secure you are when he's your anchor. I mean, the anchor that they
throw the whole the ship can break. But this one, that's one. One day Peter and the disciples
on the sea in the storm was raging. And Peter was was threatened by the storm. And then he saw
our anchor walking on the sea in the midst of the storm. And Peter realized that the storm
that was threatening him was already under the feet of Jesus. Oh, somebody hear me. That storm
that is threatening you is already under the feet of Jesus. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Jesus
is your anchor. The storm threatening you is under the feet of Jesus. And Jesus is your anchor.
So unless Jesus goes down,
that same Jesus who is our anchor in another storm was raging and the disciples were
panicking like we do because they didn't know they had an anchor. Step as a storm.
So they thought the storm could ultimately destroy them. They thought the storm would
ultimately win. They looked at the storm and they thought they had no future. They had no future
beyond the storm. It was too terrible, too hard, too, too, too, too, too, too destructive. No
future. No future. They felt so weak. But what they didn't know was right there in that boat
in the midst of the storm. They had an anchor. They had an anchor. They had an anchor who
would secure them in the storm and ensure that they would survive the storm. They would outlast
the storm. Say, Hallelujah. You see, your anchor Jesus can be calm in the midst of the storm
because he's Lord over the storm. He can be calm in the midst of the storms because he's a ruler
of the winds and the waves. He can be calm because he can say to the wind peace and the wind will
obey his will. He can say to the sea rest and the sea will rest. He can say to the storm
go to sleep and the storm will go to sleep. He said, Akka for our soul. So your hope is not tied
to anything earthly because anything earthly can be taken away. Anything earthly can be lost.
Our hope doesn't go down. We don't, our anchor is not in anything earthly. Our anchor is in heaven
beyond the veil, anchored in heaven to Jesus, anchored in heaven to the throne.
And because that is where your hope is, nothing on earth can ever
overcome that which holds you. And I said that, I said that intentionally, that which holds you
because many times within we're holding on to the anchor. But it's the anchor who is holding on to us.
And our security is based upon how strong the anchor is. Well, our anchor is Jesus Christ,
the person and the scripture says the priest. So both the person and the priestly work of Jesus
Christ is what guarantees that no matter the storm, that storm will cease. And you
will emerge secure and steadfast in Jesus name. Can you, can you receive that? Can you believe
that? Can you embrace that? So Jesus, you are the anchor for my soul. Peter, stop being stressful
and all stop it. Your anchor, Jesus, rules over the wind and the waves and the storms you're facing
are under his feet. Peter rests because notice he's calm in the midst of the storm because he knows
who he is. Peter, this anchor called Jesus. Remember, they put him in the grade.
And on the third day, he arose. What does that mean, Peter? It means
not even death is strong enough to withhold or withstand his power.
So here being, I don't know what you're going through right now, but if you do understand, trust him.
I don't know how weak you may be feeling right now, but trust him.
You may not be able to see, anyway, out of this, but trust him.
And learn, listen to me as I'm bringing this, of course, I want to be practical. Learn
to speak to yourself more than you listen to yourself. Speak to yourself. Speak to yourself.
And remind yourself that you have this hope, step as and secure. In Jesus' name,
Father, we thank you so much for your word. We pray that this message will encourage your
people. It will strengthen them. It will renew their hope and that if there's anyone here who
is dealing right now with despair or discouraged, but even worse, depression, because somebody
that they were anchored to left or job that they were anchored to was lost.
Or they've gotten a bad report from the doctor concerning their health. Lord, let this message
reinforce their hope that because Jesus lives and because of the promise that God made,
their hope is steadfast and secure. And that hope is anchored in the whole of
Holies in the person of Jesus Christ. Let them be stranded with a new consciousness of the
everlasting mixture of the hope they have in the mighty and inculcable name of Jesus.
Our end with this, I think I need to say this, we didn't read the whole of Romans 5.
But if you want to read the entire Romans 5, you will see all that God did
for us through Christ. I hinted at it when I said when Jesus was crucified, we were crucified.
When Jesus was buried, we were buried. According to the scriptures, when Jesus was raised,
we were in a mystery, but it's real. God didn't go that far.
Do you hear me? He didn't go that far to rescue you from the enemy's hand.
He didn't go that far to deliver you from sin's power and Satan's dominion.
So far as to make you one with the Son, so far as to take you through that experience,
we call redemption, in order to bring you out with Christ. And then have you seated with him
in heaven and places according to the scriptures. God did not go that far to allow the enemy
to be able to come back and undo what he's done. My brother and sister, if God did that,
it would not be against you. It would be something he's permitting against himself.
It would not happen. God will never abandon you. God will never leave you. God will never forsake you.
Did you hear what I said? Say never, never, never. It is impossible.
He cannot forsake you without forsaking the Son. And he did that once. He's not doing it again.
And when he did it on the cross, he was doing it for you. He cannot forsake you without forsaking
Jesus. And he's not going to do that. You are the fruit of Christ's work.
Jesus died for you. He shed his blood for you. He gave us all for you. You are too valuable and
it costs him too much. For God to let the enemy take you or have his way. It's not possible.
God is for you. And nothing against you is going to prosper. It's all going to work for the glory
of God in the name of Jesus. And nothing will separate you from the love of God which is in Christ.
Jesus come and say, Amen.
So don't believe the lie from the devil. He's a liar. And that's all he has to use against us.
Lies. Because part of the redemption story is that Jesus spoke principality and powers.
Jesus disarmed them. That means he took from them their weapons so that they possess no weapons
for which they can harm you. He's a liar. Did you hear me? I don't know why the Holy Spirit
helped me emphasize in this but somebody needs to hear me right now. God has invested too much in
you for himself. The sun has invested him too much for himself, for that glory, for them to
stop. It's not going to happen in the name of Jesus. Now here's a good news. If you were here
today and you have not yet received the Savior, you need to receive the Savior because everything
I said is for the one who is in Christ. If you're not in Christ, you got nothing to anchor your hope
on except the things of the world which can go like this. But if you're in Christ, then this is your
anchor and it might be possible that someone is here right now and you have not received the Savior.
You have not put your trust in him and believed that he died for you and he's coming back but
those who believe in him, you have not said to him, Lord, I've received you as Savior and Lord.
And that's so important. And so I want to give you an opportunity and you were watching online,
you respond also to this in Jesus name. But if you're here today and you said, Bishop,
I would like to be prayed for. We'll ask the pastors and the elders to please come.
I would like to be prayed for because I want to, at this point, surrender to Jesus Christ and
acknowledge that He is Lord and Savior and place my faith in Him for my salvation. I want this
eternal life you talked about and only Jesus can give it. Then we want you to come and talk
with these people. Tell them what you want. They'll pray with you. But then you may have some
other needs. I know there are some of you that are dealing with some tough situations that
perhaps that's why the Spirit of God had this message come. To encourage your strengthen,
you have you need prayer for something. You just need someone to agree with you at their
peak with yours. Come to and let these pastors and elders pray with you.

# Sermon Summary and Prayer Points

## "Angels On Call" - Bishop Darlingston Johnson

---

## SERMON SUMMARY

**Main Theme:** Believers have access to powerful angelic ministry as heirs of salvation, and this ministry is activated through speaking God's Word and prayer.

Bishop Johnson opens by establishing that angels are real, active, and directly involved in believers' lives today, just as they were in the Christmas story. He reminds us that we often live as though heaven is silent and help is scarce, but Scripture reveals we are surrounded by angels assigned to minister to us.

**Key Theological Points:**

Angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve Him, and God has commanded them to serve His children. This is not reserved for spiritual elite - it's a covenant blessing for every believer who has placed faith in Jesus Christ. The ministry of angels is one of the primary ways God cares for, protects, and supplies the needs of His children.

**The Three Roles of Angels:**
1. **Heaven's Worshipers** - They continually worship God and direct all worship to Him alone
2. **Heaven's Warriors** - They fight unseen battles on our behalf so we are not overwhelmed
3. **Protective Services Providers** - They minister physically and spiritually, from major interventions to small daily helps

**Critical Spiritual Laws Governing Angels:**

The sermon's most powerful revelation concerns why some believers experience more angelic activity than others. Angels operate legally under authority and respond to two primary things:

1. **The Voice of God's Word** (Psalm 103:20) - Angels "heed the voice of His word." They don't respond to tears, emotions, or needs alone. They need the spoken Word to create legal authority for action. When believers voice God's promises - declaring "The Lord is my refuge," "No weapon formed against me will prosper," or "My God shall supply all my needs" - they create the legal environment angels need to function freely.

2. **Prayer Based on God's Word** - Jesus demonstrated this when He said He could ask the Father and 72,000 angels would instantly respond. Daniel's prayer dispatched an angel immediately. Prayer combined with speaking God's Word releases angelic activity.

**Practical Application:**

Bishop Johnson emphasizes that many believers have an untapped "angelic balance" in their spiritual account because they're not voicing God's Word. Our words matter tremendously - they either give life to God's promises (activating angels) or give life to fears and curses (potentially empowering demonic activity). Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

The sermon includes powerful testimonies of angelic protection - from his friend who declared "I refuse to die" as his car went under a tanker and survived, to Bishop's own experience of his car supernaturally stopping before pulling into dangerous traffic, to being mysteriously prompted to catch his flight.

**Conclusion:** While angels are magnificent and powerful, Jesus is far greater. As we learn from angels who bow before Him, we too must worship Christ, the greatest gift of all.

## SCRIPTURE-BASED PRAYER POINTS

### 1. **For Grateful Recognition of Angelic Ministry**
**Prayer Focus:** Father, we thank You that we are not alone - You have assigned angels as ministering spirits to serve us as heirs of salvation. Open our eyes to recognize their activity in our lives.

**Scripture Foundation:** Hebrews 1:14 - "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?"

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, we acknowledge that angels are our covenant blessing, our inheritance as Your children. Thank You that in this very moment, angels surround us - more angels than we can see with natural eyes. We are grateful that You have not left us to face battles alone but have charged these powerful beings to care for us, protect us, and minister on our behalf. Increase our awareness of their presence and activity.

### 2. **For the Discipline to Speak God's Word Consistently**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would develop the habit of voicing God's Word daily, creating the legal environment for angels to function freely.

**Scripture Foundation:** Psalm 103:20 - "Bless the Lord, you His angels, who excel in strength, who do His word, heeding the voice of His word"

**Prayer Declaration:** Heavenly Father, forgive us for the times we have been silent, allowing fears and doubts to fill our mouths instead of Your promises. Give us the discipline to speak Your Word daily and consistently. Let our mouths be filled with declarations of Your truth - "The Lord is my refuge and my fortress," "No weapon formed against me shall prosper," "By His stripes I am healed." Train us to voice Your Word so that the angels assigned to us have the legal authority they need to enforce Your will in our lives. Break every habit of negative confession and replace it with Word-based declarations.

### 3. **For Protection and Deliverance Through Angelic Ministry**
**Prayer Focus:** That God would command His angels to provide protective services and deliverance in unseen and seen battles.

**Scripture Foundation:** Psalm 91:11-12 - "For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone" (referenced in sermon); 2 Kings 19:35 - One angel destroying 185,000 enemy soldiers

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, we ask You to command Your angels concerning us - charge them to bear us up, to protect us in all our ways. Just as one angel destroyed 185,000 enemies threatening King Hezekiah, release Your warring angels to fight battles in the unseen realm so we will not be overwhelmed in what we can see. Protect us from accidents, dangers, attacks, and every scheme of the enemy. Send angels to encamp around us and our families. Let every weapon fashioned against us fail, and let every battle meant to destroy our future and destiny be won by Your angelic host. We declare: "Don't mess with God's angels assigned to us!"

### 4. **For Strengthening and Physical Ministry in Times of Weariness**
**Prayer Focus:** That angels would minister physical strength, provision, and refreshing in seasons of exhaustion and spiritual warfare.

**Scripture Foundation:** Matthew 4:11 - Angels ministering to Jesus after 40 days of fasting; 1 Kings 19:5-8 - Angel providing food to Elijah that sustained him 40 days; Luke 22:43 - Angel strengthening Jesus in Gethsemane

**Prayer Declaration:** Father, just as You sent angels to strengthen Jesus when He was weary after fasting and warfare, and just as angels fed Elijah with food that sustained him for 40 days, we ask for the ministry of angels in our moments of weariness. When we are tired physically, emotionally, or spiritually, send Your angels to minister strength and refreshment to us. Let them bring supernatural provision - whether physical food, encouragement, energy, or divine help. We declare: "God, I need the ministry of angels right now to strengthen me." Release heaven's resources to meet every need we face today.

### 5. **For Prayer That Activates Angelic Response**
**Prayer Focus:** That our prayer life would be rooted in God's Word, releasing immediate angelic response and intervention.

**Scripture Foundation:** Daniel 10:12 - "Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words"; Matthew 26:53 - Jesus' awareness that He could ask the Father and receive 72,000 angels instantly

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, teach us to pray prayers based on Your Word that dispatch angels immediately. Like Daniel, may our words be heard in heaven from the first day we pray. Like Jesus who knew He could ask and 72,000 angels would respond, give us confidence that when we pray according to Your Word and Your will, angelic ministry is released. We refuse to pray powerless prayers filled with doubt and fear. Instead, we will pray believing prayers backed by Your promises. Let our prayer life create the legal conditions that allow angels to function freely, frequently, and fully in our lives. Send the angels we need for breakthrough, provision, healing, protection, and deliverance.

### 6. **For Guarding Our Words and Rejecting Enemy Lies**
**Prayer Focus:** That believers would refuse to give voice to fears, curses, or enemy suggestions, only speaking what aligns with God's Word.

**Scripture Foundation:** Proverbs 18:21 - "Death and life are in the power of the tongue"; James 3:10 - "Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so"

**Prayer Declaration:** Father, we repent for every time we have used our tongue to give life to the enemy's lies - declaring sickness, defeat, lack, or destruction over ourselves. We recognize that death and life are in the power of our tongue. Help us to resist every temptation to voice fears, anxieties, bad dreams, or negative circumstances. When the enemy plants thoughts of defeat in our minds, we will not give them life with our words. Instead, we will open our mouths and declare Your Word, giving life to Your will and purposes. Let no corrupt word proceed from our mouths, but only what is good for edification. We refuse to confuse our angels with contradictory words - we will speak consistently the truth of Your Word.

---

### 7. **For Increased Alignment with Spiritual Laws Governing Angels**
**Prayer Focus:** That we would understand and operate in the spiritual laws that release greater angelic activity in our lives.

**Scripture Foundation:** Hebrews 1:14 - Angels as ministering spirits; Psalm 103:20 - Angels heeding the voice of God's word

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord, remove our ignorance concerning the spiritual laws that govern angelic ministry. Though all Your children are entitled to angelic help, we recognize that some experience it more fully because they are more aligned with Your spiritual principles. Teach us these laws - that angels respond to Your spoken Word, that they are released through believing prayer, that they operate legally under Your authority. We desire to withdraw from our "angelic balance" that has remained untapped. Show us how to increase angelic activity in our lives, not through our own righteousness, but through alignment with Your Word and ways. Let us be a people who create legal environments where angels function freely on our behalf.

### 8. **For Worship and Honor to Jesus Above All**
**Prayer Focus:** That while we thank God for angels, we would always remember Jesus is far greater and worthy of all worship.

**Scripture Foundation:** Revelation 19:10, 22:8-9 - Angels refusing worship and directing it to God; Colossians 1:16 - All things, including angels, created through Christ and for Christ

**Prayer Declaration:** Lord Jesus, while we are grateful for the ministry of angels, we acknowledge that You are far greater than any created being. Angels bow before You. They were created by You and for You. Like the angels in Revelation who redirected John's worship saying "I am a fellow servant - worship God," we too declare that all worship belongs to You alone. You are our greatest gift, far exceeding any blessing angels can bring. As we learn from angels who continually bow before You, teach us to worship You with the same devotion, wonder, and reverence. All glory, honor, and praise belong to You, Lord Jesus. You are exalted above all. Amen.

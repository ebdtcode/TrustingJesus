Hallelujah. Father, we thank you for the opportunity that we have now to speak your word Lord Jesus you promise that When we stand to speak in your name, you will give us the words to speak. I Believe that this morning, and I want to say thank you for fulfilling their promise in a powerful and amazing way Right now. Thank you for utterance from me and understanding for your people in the mighty name of Jesus Amen. If you wish the person next to you, Mary Christmas Yeah, yeah, it's And that I I want to continue to speak around a theme that is related to Christmas Merry Christmas. Thank you. So let me ask you a question How many of you here believe in angels? Raise it high. Amen And how many of you believe that these angels Walking the earth are directly involved in your Person of faith and not just here, but they actually involved in your affairs How many of you could tell me a story Of an experience that you had and whether anybody else thinks of you are convinced That this was an angel that intervened for me You're all who can say I'm convinced Stand I just want to see how many people say all right Well, we have a lot of believers here God bless you. Thank you. You may be seated Hallelujah Amen Unfortunately many believe us live as though Heaven is quiet and help Is scarce many of us We pray as if God is far away We face battles as though we are alone and we're unsupported But scripture tells us something radically different The scriptures reveal that we are not alone The scriptures reveal that there are angels among us And that those angels are all assignment In this room right now, they're probably more angels here than human beings And the Bible reveals not a lot but enough about angels to excite us who are heirs of Christ So I want you to turn with me to Hebrews 114 and Of course, we know that the christmas story is full of the activities of angels We see angels appearing to marry and And now sing to her The birth of her child and how she would become Pregnant of the Holy Spirit we see angels appearing to Joseph in a dream and and speaking to him more than once in the christmas story We see angels As a chemit choir singing and worshipping the lord and all over That everywhere it seems the christmas story as recorded in the gospels The stories fills with evidence of angelic activity right here among us and those angels were very active and Nobody really except Mary and Joseph and Zechariah and those who are close to them even knew most people What about their business not aware of the amount of angelic activity that was taking place right there In their midst and so the truth is we go about our business and We're oblivious to the fact that angels are at work But yet they are very active Here among us and the christmas story reminds us of those angels and and they give us a reason To be grateful In a special way those of us who are airs of salvation So in Hebrew chapter one Paul is speaking and he's talking about angels and he's talking about how much greater Jesus is than angels And then he says this are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister For those who will inherit salvation Are they not all let's say that are they not all ministering spirits sent forth To minister for those who will inherit salvation or For those who are the airs of salvation how many of you are airs of salvation Amen Every single one who has placed his or her faith in Jesus Christ You are an air of salvation And according to this verse angels Are ministering spirits That have been sent by God To minister or to serve you Who are the airs of salvation did you know that Did you know that as a child of God God your father Has blessed you with a host of angels whose job is To look After you whose job is to care for you Whose job is to be present and we'll look a little bit more quickly closer at some of the things that's that that's that these angels do But let me begin by just defining what angels are angels are spiritual beings Who are created by God To serve God They're what spiritual beings Created by God to serve God And God commands them and they obey his word It so happens that God has commanded them To serve you I want you to notice here. This is not Something that is for one or two special people This is not something the minister of angels is not something that Only so-called great men of God get to experience It's not something for one or two or three or four of us The Bible says the minister of angels Is a blessing that God has given To all of his children it is a covenant blessing Are you here say angels are a covenant blessing They are your inheritance God has given them to you They are present right here and everywhere you go Angels are present Say hallelujah Notice I said they are created by God They are extremely powerful They are created so created By God angels You know when someone dies they don't become your guided angel I don't know where that came from You know, and some of y'all Who should know better? I've heard some of you speak at funeral so I'll say this by God. I'm sorry You had a guided angel long before that person passed away Say hallelujah Amen, so you're not waiting for someone to get wings to come and take care of you God has done so much more Amen God created angels And God assigned them to take care of his children You had angels That were created and have been charged to take care of you Amen the spiritual beings we cannot see them ordinarily, but they are able to manifest themselves physically And so there are times when when people in the scriptures the Bible reveals They're manifesting themselves In physical form, so people actually see a physical creature that is actually an angel But they are spiritual beings They are extremely Powerful I don't have the time to break down all they do so I would just reduce what they do into three categories. They are heavens worshipers That's probably the most important thing they do. They worship Amen they beholds him and they worship him and they worship him. That's that's what they do And they are aware very aware that they are not to be worshipped Amen Now there there are some angels who fail they're called demons and Satan and one of the things that happened was they Decided they wanted to be worship But the angels that serve God today know That all worship belongs to the Lord Amen In the book of Revelation Even John the Apostle when he saw the angels there was so glorious, so majestic in the appearance That he fell down and each time twice in acts in Revelation at Jim chapter 19 and another twice he appears And John drops and the angel immediately no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Do that I am a A servant just like you I'm a servant just like you like the prophets. I'm a servant just like you don't don't do that worship God worship God worship God and so the angels will always point to God They'll always point to Jesus and they're one of the things to do as worship us Not only do they worship but they direct all worship To the only one who deserves to be worshipped Amen and we worship only God. Amen. We worship God the Father worship God the Son and we worship God the Holy Spirit But angels are worshipers and the heavens worship us. They're also heavens warriors Amen, you know, there's some battles that That are happening and we had no And awareness of the thank God we don't Because we won't sleep You know, we won't be able to do anything if we knew some of the battles that are being fought so God mercifully Keeps those things away from us, but thank God they're angels That are fighting battles in the unseen so that we cannot be overwhelmed in the scene Say hallelujah come and say thank you God They are angels that are fighting battles in the unseen so that we His children may not be overcome in the scene Say hallelujah and and and some of those battles are about you about your future about your destiny Thank God for the minister of angel powerful powerful worship us. Don't mess with my angel So the person next to you don't mess with my angel I believe I got at least two so don't mess with my angels Because what they have been assigned they are ministering spirits that God has sent To take care of me Are you hearing me? Amen the scripture says in some not the one he has charged them that means he's giving them this order It's an assignment to bear us up in their hands so that we would not dash our feet Are you hearing me with my stumble and fault they have been charged with that heaven has commanded them as from their present Amen Is what's this king Sinatra Ritz in the cherub Who be decided to mess with with King Hezekiah and Israel And threatened to destroy them The army that malachites and all about and and and and and King Hezekiah went and prayed He You know how when you mess with people's children to go to their parents to tell their parents that boy is messing with me And then the parents come to your rescue Well, this man was threatening to destroy Uh King Hezekiah and the armies of Israel absolutely and so what did he do? He went to the father And he prayed to the god. He said god Here with this man is saying Here he's saying not god. I want you to show that you are the only true god Amen Don't allow what he does to prosper Come to our rescue The bible says that night. Yes, one angel How many And I said I got at least two And when I need more They're available But just one angel that night got up and went into the aunt the camp and one angel that night Killed a hundred and six the five thousand soldiers just one Imagine such powerful creatures Created by god to serve him. He has charged them To minister to you As an air Of salvation my goodness What do these angels do? They're worship us, but they're warriors And they provide protective services protective services You think the president of the United States is the only one with secret service And then you don't know who you are You don't know who whose children you are even the children the president get secret service Isn't that so? My goodness This is not I'm not without preaching for fun this morning This is reality This is truth every day You have angels that god has charged To to be with you and to serve you And to minister that word to serve of the minister means to render service Forb means on your behalf So angels Have been charged To render service on your behalf. You see god has many means by which he blesses us He blesses us through his word He blesses us by the power of the Holy Spirit He blesses us through word another god uses us to help one another But I'm Want to remind you Or inform you That one of the prime merit things are ways by which god ministers to us and takes care of us Supplies our knees protects us etc is through the ministry of angels So what we see taking place in the Christmas story with all of those angels That's not a one-off. That's not a something that happened then it doesn't happen anymore This stuff But you see happening with angels appearing and angels delivering messages and and angels guiding and angels Delivering that you see taking place in the Christmas story and in other places scripture This is taking place all the time today Now when I ask how many of you feel definitely you've had an experience with angels a good number you stood up And that's the one or two times you know the angels But man they they every day they're busy say hallelujah So this is not infrequent people we live god created us not to live by ourselves But to live in an environment that live in a world that is inhabited by angels Who are there with us to help us Raise your hands if father this Christmas I'm reminded of Your love and your provision Thank you for the ministry of angels Amen They they they provide they provide protection they they they actually minister to us in the physically Again, we may not when you know, we're not aware of it But again look at what happened in the life of Jesus remember when Jesus spent 40 days praying The Bible says at the end of the 40 days he was engaging in 10 spiritual warfare And he was weary he was tired the Bible says angel's king They are sent forth walked to minister to those who are airs of salvation Jesus at that point in time was a man In Med he was the father's child, but he was human and he was weak he was tired And God sent angels to minister to him Now I don't understand all of this stuff because I was I said God why you didn't just speak the word and let Jesus Get strengthened But he sent angels God created angels and sent angels and those angels attended to him physically He was weary physically and they came and strengthen him Sometimes when you're weary and tired Lift your hand and say thank you God for the minister of angels And as you can say God I need the minister of angels right now in the strengthen me You don't pray to angels you don't talk to them and command them But you talk to the father. He's your father. I'd need now the minister of angels to strengthen me Again at the end when he was in the Garden of Cassimony remember how he was again weary wrestling And the Bible says what did the God do for him that angels came in minister to him The prophet Elijah Right Elijah Elijah after that major spiritual battle with the prophets of bail came on attack spiritually and he was he was discouraged. She was weak. He And and God sent an angel who found him and And minister to him physically gave him something to eat And that whatever it was I don't know whether it was earth the food and if it is we need to discover what that is so we can Benefit or whether there was something happening but the angels actually knew he needed food He needed physical energy And gave him something to eat and the Bible says he became so strong He lives on the energy that that thing supplied for how long 40 days But an angel did that You see God sent them to minister for us to us They're real You know what I'm saying you hear I'm saying They are real and they are present In your life they're there and that's during heritage Now and the heritage has to be received The fact is not everyone enjoys the same level of angelic activity Not because not every child of God is entitled But what is an inheritance has to be received Him and the truth is some of us Experience the benefits of these angels and their minister farm more than others And it's not because the angels are unwilling But it's because many of us are ignorant of the spiritual laws That govern the activity of angels you see Angels operate legally They don't just acts independently They don't just do what needs to be done They are actually Service which means they are under authority I hear me There are laws that govern their activity So those who experience a lot of angelic activity are not more righteous and more holy But they are more aligned to the spiritual laws That angels obey Are you here? And angel doesn't know she's crying she's weeping And let me go help her that's not how they work They're not responding to our tears and not responding to emotions What do they respond to go to Psalm 103 20 Psalm 103 20 Hallelujah Psalm 103 20 All right Looks like we haven't some problems there But Psalm 103 verse 20 tells us that the angels Harken to the voice of his word Let's read that Bless the Lord You as angels who excel in strength Who do his word Who heed the voice of his word What do angels do They heed the voice of his word So they don't just do what they want to do Or they don't act based upon emotions They don't act based upon need They are under command They are servants of God and they only obey the voice Of his word not just the word But the word spoken Because that's the command When when we speak the word Which angels were created to serve God so that's the only Only wonder listening to and getting the commands from I hear me And so when we're speaking a lot of stuff that That it's not aligned With the word the angels stand there Because if they move on that word They will be in disobedience to God So they're always listening For the voice of his word not his word in the page Not his word in your mind But the word spoken The word spoken creates the legal Environments And gives the angels the legal authority they need to act They may see oh man she needs help but I don't have a word yet I can't move Think about army Well trained well arms And they're ready to move But army That is well trained knows a responsible orders We've got the guns we've got the uh we've got the arms we've got the power we know what we can do But we're going to stand here and tell we hear the word Somebody got to command us Somebody with authority needs to speak And when they speak we will move instantly we all have to take sure but until they speak We can't do nothing I hear me And so many of our angels are there watching As they can't move Because they're waiting Not for your tears or mine Not for your complaining they don't move because you complain They don't move because you cry They don't move because they feel sorry for you They are an army They are servants They are an authority They need the word of God Because that's where they get the legal authority to act Until then they have a little legal basis to move Hey man, I'm uh I have a friend of mine who was Who was a student or Roberts and you know, he's from Nigeria and he went back Oh, but he came to the states that was sharing with testicles showed us pictures How he was on the highway and he lost control of his car and he was going I mean there's this tanker and he was going straight under that tanker And this is what he said I refuse to die That car went under that tanker He came out Now you may say that was just go into this I say the angels heard a word that was in alignment with the word of God And when they when he voiced it That word Became enforceable legally Are you hear me so those who will experience angelic ministry in his fullness and the benefits of the presence of the angels Are those who will create the legal environment in which angels can function freely And you create that legal environment by voicing and declaring the word of the Lord That's why you have to be careful Because if you set up and you say I'm always sick the angels can't enforce that They get They will stand there and let you be always sick Because why it's not it's not the word of the Lord So they have no legal authority in the truth and now demons like would love for you to say you know demons are also angels just And the spiritual world operates similarly So you gotta otherwise those ain't those demons and you do so with your words You go to sleep and you have a dream and the dream you eat something or whatever somebody's chasing you You get up and you say the devil is after me The people are trying to put a put witchcraft on me And it's my grandmother you know what you're doing You are with your word giving life to that curse And with that word you're creating the legal environment for demons so enforce it The angels can't help you there but the demons can The demons are not submitted to God's word so they don't need God's word They will obey yours man So one of the laws that govern angelic activity is that angels that are present Will not be moved by our emotions by our tears the other thing that moves them is the word of God But that word must be voiced So that armistens and that army will do nothing until somebody who has the authority To command those officers will get to command and then they will go into effect angels are like that They wait for the legal authorities to act and the legal authority is granted that when one who is an heir Speaks the word Of God and when you voice it. Ah, I have a legal authority now to enforce it So when you say the Lord is my refuge and my fortress Uh-huh the angels have the legal authority to enforce that Amen when you say no weapon form against me will prosper Ah, that's the word of the Lord the angels now have the authority the legal authority to enforce it When you say my god to supply all my needs According to his riches in glory Guess what the angels now have the authority to go and find whatever it is that you're going to need Because you have created a legal environment that allows them to function Are you listening to me Some of us were confusing our angels We said this with it What do you want me to do Speak consistently speak the word of the Lord So so angels are present but you can have a lot of money in the back And then I know what draws me me And some of us have a have a angelic balance In our account that is not being used when I withdrawing it because we're not giving the voice We're not giving God's word the voice We're not speaking it. So here's what I'm saying speak God's word Declare take some not at one and every day Speak some not at one Take those promises of God what Christ has done and every day speak in alignment those who are seeing the angelic Ministry in a greater way are doing so not because they're more holy and more righteous But because they are more in alignment they align with the spiritual law that angels obey So one of the ways that you're going to increase angelic activity in your life is where you open your mouth And you're going to declare on a consistent basis you're going to voice the word resist the temptation to think you know what A lot of these thoughts as say John put in your minds will die And never become a reality if you never give them life with your words The Bible says death and life are in the power of the top So say John puts a thought in your mind and then waits for you to give life to it with your words Don't give life to those fears and anxieties Open your mouth and declare the word of God because that we give life To God's will and God's purposes in your life and angels stand to enforce that That's why they're here. There's service of God sent to enforce God's will in your life But they're waiting for you who are an heir of God to give voice to that word to that will so they can execute it As God has determined for them to do Here's another thing that is so critical It may be the difference between why one person is experiencing the benefits of angelic The other is prayer Listen to me listen to what listen to what Jesus said listen to what Jesus said what Jesus was on the cross What Jesus was on the cross What did Jesus say concerning angels Amen What Jesus would be inclusive when they were beating him when they're resting him before he got to the cross and they and and and what was a Peter who took the The sword and cut off the ear of Whoever came to arrest him Jesus said Peter Don't you know? I'm a son Angels are created to serve Don't you know I can ask the father right now And the father will send me 12 legions I think there's six thousand in one legion so that's seventy two thousand Jesus said presently right now I asked and right now they will show up so they were ready There was seventy two thousand angel just waiting for the command He says I can ask right now and seventy two thousand will come The father will send them But if you notice none of those angels came Not one seventy two thousand were ready not one showed up They stood there and Jesus was arrested They took him to the cross they crucified him Even though they were ready once if they had gotten the word They would have moved Jesus would not have gone to the cross We would not have been saved so Jesus says let the angels say this one I want to face it I want to go through the suffering. I'm not asking for rescue from this one because I got to go to that cross I got to die. I got to pay that price so they can be delivered so father I'm not I'm not going to ask for the angels because I know right now if I ask instantly They will show up Show that angels are ready to act At this At a moment's notice But why didn't they move? There's one explanation Jesus didn't ask Why is it that angels are there and they sometimes don't move Because prayer Hasn't been made So the angels will respond to the word that you declare And angels respond to prayer Based on that word And so the more we pray based upon the word and the more we back up a prayer We're declaring the word the more angelic activity we will personally experience in our lives I hear me So no prayer Well, it looks like no angelic ministry not because angelic ministry is not available. You got 72,000 angels that could be released right now But the prayer faith Isn't being prayed and the word of God isn't being spoken And so they stand While you cry It's not that they're not moved But they cannot act Unless they act legally And it takes your believing prayer and it takes the word of God in your mouth being spoken For you to create the legal conditions that allow them to function freely Frequently fully in your life I encourage you Begin to do so Amen Daniel in Daniel chapter 10 Daniel took the word of God and went to God in prayer And the scripture says that Daniel kept standing kept believing for 21 days And then the angel of the Lord showed up And the angel said the minute As soon as you open your mouth, I was dispatched Again, I'm showing you the connection between the words spoken Prayer based on the word a high angels respond But that prayer and that word have to be You keep your mouth silent and angels will be still So I want to encourage you don't don't don't don't don't be silent Open your mouth but when you open your mouth make sure You are voicing the word of the Lord so that the angels can provide the level of existence that Is required and that God wants them to deliver on your behalf You hear me So as we go into this Christmas and we go beyond into next year Don't don't don't believe the lie That you are you are under source Don't don't believe the lie that you are alone You know don't believe the lie that there's nobody to help you No, no, no all of that will keep your angels at attention But when you fill your heart and you fill your mind and you fill your mouth with the reality that angels are there And you consciously begin to thank God for them and voice What God has said concerning you You will see the angelic activity in your life increasing and then you know what's done. So I'm recognizing and acknowledging it And let me end with this angels won't want to do big things I mean in terms of the protective services. I you let me get you one story that I'm done maybe two But you know they're protecting us all the time But you know most of the time we don't know what they're protecting us from but there are few things that uh this one And I shared with you recently how I I'm convinced that we were delivered from the accident Well, there was another accident Better years ago that I was safe from and I am absolutely 100% once convinced I was protected by my angel Because I had started to drive But I wasn't I didn't have a lot of experience yet in driving and so I was coming From Orabas University coming off the campus and I'm about to pull into Georgia Avenue I was Georgia. I don't know. What's some other name Louis Avenue Louis Avenue And that was a major street and and and and and and traffic the people generally travel quite fast there And I did not look you know new driver I didn't look left and right and left That's why you're supposed to do right right left no left right left I didn't do that and I was about to pull my car directly onto Louis Avenue And I tell you that car wouldn't move It was like somebody stood before the car and say you're not going anywhere I'm the the car did this I'm telling this car like I must have been traveling 67 miles per hour two seconds And that guy would have jawbone I wouldn't be a passenger here today Don't tell me there wasn't an angel there Protecting me They do big things It's scripture as you see them Doing some powerful things like shutting the mouth of the lion But they also do small things too They're here to minister So the other day when I was coming back from Liberia I was at the airport in Togo Was it Togo? Yeah Just sitting down and resting and not paying attention And the plane was about to take off Seriously, I I don't know what I was that I didn't even look after my wash So even I was just sitting there relaxing And then I just felt get up Because I don't know I just stood again I didn't get up because I was thinking I was late I just got up and started to stroll And as soon as I got up somebody the guy was I even said Johnson we're looking for we're looking for you Don't tell me it wasn't an angel I said my man you better get up the plane is about to Raise your hands if father thank you For the minutes of angels I'm never alone I'm never on the source We thank you that angels minister On our behalf We will Not be silent We will Voice your word We will Give them the legal authority To work in our lives We will Create the legal environment that allows them to function freely In Jesus name And everybody said Amen and everybody said Now as great as angels are There's one far greater Thank God for angels for your greatest gift is Jesus And before him angels bar Learn from the angels to bar Before him In Jesus name Amen and amen God bless you. Thank you

**[00:00 - 00:04]** Hallelujah. Father, we thank you for the opportunity that we have now to speak your word

**[00:06 - 00:08]** Lord Jesus you promise that

**[00:08 - 00:14]** When we stand to speak in your name, you will give us the words to speak. I

**[00:15 - 00:22]** Believe that this morning, and I want to say thank you for fulfilling their promise in a powerful and amazing way

**[00:23 - 00:30]** Right now. Thank you for utterance from me and understanding for your people in the mighty name of Jesus

**[00:31 - 00:33]** Amen. If you wish the person next to you, Mary Christmas

**[00:35 - 00:37]** Yeah, yeah, it's

**[00:41 - 00:49]** And that I I want to continue to speak around a theme that is related to Christmas

**[00:55 - 01:01]** Merry Christmas. Thank you. So let me ask you a question

**[01:02 - 01:04]** How many of you here believe in angels?

**[01:09 - 01:11]** Raise it high. Amen

**[01:12 - 01:15]** And how many of you believe that these angels

**[01:16 - 01:21]** Walking the earth are directly involved in your

**[01:22 - 01:24]** Person of faith and not just here, but they actually

**[01:25 - 01:27]** involved in your affairs

**[01:29 - 01:31]** How many of you could tell me a story

**[01:33 - 01:38]** Of an experience that you had and whether anybody else thinks of you are convinced

**[01:38 - 01:42]** That this was an angel that intervened for me

**[01:45 - 01:47]** You're all who can say I'm convinced

**[01:48 - 01:52]** Stand I just want to see how many people say all right

**[01:54 - 01:57]** Well, we have a lot of believers here God bless you. Thank you. You may be seated

**[01:58 - 02:00]** Hallelujah

**[02:00 - 02:03]** Amen

**[02:03 - 02:06]** Unfortunately many believe us live as though

**[02:07 - 02:09]** Heaven is quiet

**[02:09 - 02:10]** and help

**[02:10 - 02:12]** Is scarce many of us

**[02:13 - 02:15]** We pray as if God is far away

**[02:17 - 02:21]** We face battles as though we are alone and we're unsupported

**[02:23 - 02:26]** But scripture tells us something radically different

**[02:30 - 02:33]** The scriptures reveal that we are not alone

**[02:35 - 02:38]** The scriptures reveal that there are angels among us

**[02:39 - 02:43]** And that those angels are all assignment

**[02:45 - 02:49]** In this room right now, they're probably more angels here than human beings

**[02:54 - 03:02]** And the Bible reveals not a lot but enough about angels to excite us who are heirs of Christ

**[03:04 - 03:07]** So I want you to turn with me to Hebrews 114 and

**[03:08 - 03:13]** Of course, we know that the christmas story is full of the activities of angels

**[03:14 - 03:18]** We see angels appearing to marry and

**[03:20 - 03:22]** And now sing to her

**[03:22 - 03:28]** The birth of her child and how she would become

**[03:30 - 03:38]** Pregnant of the Holy Spirit we see angels appearing to Joseph in a dream and and speaking to him more than once in the christmas story

**[03:39 - 03:41]** We see angels

**[03:41 - 03:46]** As a chemit choir singing and worshipping the lord and all over

**[03:47 - 03:51]** That everywhere it seems the christmas story as recorded in the gospels

**[03:52 - 04:02]** The stories fills with evidence of angelic activity right here among us and those angels were very active and

**[04:03 - 04:09]** Nobody really except Mary and Joseph and Zechariah and those who are close to them even knew most people

**[04:09 - 04:15]** What about their business not aware of the amount of angelic activity that was taking place right there

**[04:16 - 04:20]** In their midst and so the truth is we go about our business and

**[04:21 - 04:25]** We're oblivious to the fact that angels are at work

**[04:26 - 04:28]** But yet they are very active

**[04:28 - 04:35]** Here among us and the christmas story reminds us of those angels and and they give us a reason

**[04:36 - 04:38]** To be grateful

**[04:39 - 04:42]** In a special way those of us who are airs of salvation

**[04:43 - 04:52]** So in Hebrew chapter one Paul is speaking and he's talking about angels and he's talking about how much greater Jesus is than angels

**[04:53 - 04:58]** And then he says this are they not all ministering spirits

**[05:00 - 05:02]** sent forth to minister

**[05:03 - 05:06]** For those who will inherit salvation

**[05:07 - 05:09]** Are they not

**[05:10 - 05:14]** all let's say that are they not all

**[05:15 - 05:17]** ministering spirits

**[05:17 - 05:19]** sent forth

**[05:19 - 05:22]** To minister for those who will

**[05:23 - 05:25]** inherit salvation or

**[05:26 - 05:32]** For those who are the airs of salvation how many of you are airs of salvation

**[05:33 - 05:35]** Amen

**[05:35 - 05:40]** Every single one who has placed his or her faith in Jesus Christ

**[05:40 - 05:44]** You are an air of salvation

**[05:45 - 05:47]** And according to this verse

**[05:48 - 05:50]** angels

**[05:50 - 05:52]** Are ministering spirits

**[05:52 - 05:55]** That have been sent by God

**[05:56 - 06:00]** To minister or to serve you

**[06:01 - 06:05]** Who are the airs of salvation did you know that

**[06:08 - 06:11]** Did you know that as a child of God

**[06:12 - 06:14]** God your father

**[06:16 - 06:26]** Has blessed you with a host of angels whose job is

**[06:27 - 06:29]** To look

**[06:29 - 06:35]** After you whose job is to care for you

**[06:36 - 06:45]** Whose job is to be present and we'll look a little bit more quickly closer at some of the things that's that that's that these angels do

**[06:46 - 06:51]** But let me begin by just defining what angels are angels are

**[06:52 - 06:53]** spiritual beings

**[06:54 - 06:57]** Who are created by God

**[06:58 - 07:00]** To serve God

**[07:02 - 07:04]** They're what

**[07:04 - 07:06]** spiritual beings

**[07:06 - 07:10]** Created by God to serve God

**[07:14 - 07:20]** And God commands them and they obey his word

**[07:21 - 07:24]** It so happens that God has commanded them

**[07:25 - 07:27]** To serve you

**[07:31 - 07:34]** I want you to notice here. This is not

**[07:36 - 07:39]** Something that is for one or two special people

**[07:41 - 07:45]** This is not something the minister of angels is not something that

**[07:47 - 07:50]** Only so-called great men of God get to experience

**[07:52 - 07:55]** It's not something for one or two or three or four of us

**[07:56 - 07:58]** The Bible says the minister of angels

**[07:59 - 08:02]** Is a blessing that God has given

**[08:03 - 08:08]** To all of his children it is a covenant blessing

**[08:13 - 08:19]** Are you here say angels are a covenant blessing

**[08:21 - 08:23]** They are your inheritance

**[08:25 - 08:27]** God has given them to you

**[08:28 - 08:33]** They are present right here and everywhere you go

**[08:34 - 08:36]** Angels are present

**[08:39 - 08:43]** Say hallelujah

**[08:43 - 08:45]** Notice I said they are created by God

**[08:48 - 08:50]** They are extremely powerful

**[08:52 - 08:54]** They are created so created

**[08:56 - 08:58]** By God angels

**[08:58 - 09:01]** You know when someone dies they don't become your guided angel

**[09:03 - 09:05]** I don't know where that came from

**[09:07 - 09:09]** You know, and some of y'all

**[09:10 - 09:12]** Who should know better?

**[09:12 - 09:16]** I've heard some of you speak at funeral so I'll say this by God. I'm sorry

**[09:17 - 09:20]** You had a guided angel long before that person passed away

**[09:21 - 09:23]** Say hallelujah

**[09:23 - 09:27]** Amen, so you're not waiting for someone to get wings to come and take care of you

**[09:28 - 09:30]** God has done so much more

**[09:30 - 09:33]** Amen God created angels

**[09:34 - 09:37]** And God assigned them to take care of his children

**[09:38 - 09:39]** You had angels

**[09:39 - 09:43]** That were created and have been charged to take care of you

**[09:44 - 09:51]** Amen the spiritual beings we cannot see them ordinarily, but they are able to manifest themselves physically

**[09:52 - 09:57]** And so there are times when when people in the scriptures the Bible reveals

**[09:58 - 10:00]** They're manifesting themselves

**[10:01 - 10:07]** In physical form, so people actually see a physical creature that is actually an angel

**[10:07 - 10:10]** But they are spiritual beings

**[10:11 - 10:13]** They are extremely

**[10:13 - 10:15]** Powerful

**[10:16 - 10:23]** I don't have the time to break down all they do so I would just reduce what they do into three categories. They are heavens worshipers

**[10:23 - 10:28]** That's probably the most important thing they do. They worship

**[10:30 - 10:36]** Amen they beholds him and they worship him and they worship him. That's that's what they do

**[10:37 - 10:41]** And they are aware very aware that they are not to be worshipped

**[10:43 - 10:45]** Amen

**[10:45 - 10:51]** Now there there are some angels who fail they're called demons and Satan and one of the things that happened was they

**[10:52 - 10:54]** Decided they wanted to be worship

**[10:54 - 10:59]** But the angels that serve God today know

**[11:00 - 11:02]** That all worship belongs to the Lord

**[11:03 - 11:05]** Amen

**[11:05 - 11:07]** In the book of Revelation

**[11:07 - 11:12]** Even John the Apostle when he saw the angels there was so glorious, so majestic in the appearance

**[11:13 - 11:20]** That he fell down and each time twice in acts in Revelation at Jim chapter 19 and another twice he appears

**[11:21 - 11:26]** And John drops and the angel immediately no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Do that

**[11:26 - 11:28]** I am a

**[11:28 - 11:30]** A servant just like you

**[11:30 - 11:36]** I'm a servant just like you like the prophets. I'm a servant just like you don't don't do that worship God

**[11:37 - 11:41]** worship God worship God and so the angels will always point to God

**[11:41 - 11:45]** They'll always point to Jesus and they're one of the things to do as worship us

**[11:45 - 11:49]** Not only do they worship but they direct all worship

**[11:49 - 11:51]** To the only one who deserves to be worshipped

**[11:52 - 12:00]** Amen and we worship only God. Amen. We worship God the Father worship God the Son and we worship God the Holy Spirit

**[12:00 - 12:06]** But angels are worshipers and the heavens worship us. They're also heavens warriors

**[12:08 - 12:11]** Amen, you know, there's some battles that

**[12:12 - 12:14]** That are happening and we had no

**[12:15 - 12:17]** And awareness of the thank God we don't

**[12:18 - 12:20]** Because we won't sleep

**[12:21 - 12:26]** You know, we won't be able to do anything if we knew some of the battles that are being fought so God mercifully

**[12:27 - 12:30]** Keeps those things away from us, but thank God they're angels

**[12:31 - 12:36]** That are fighting battles in the unseen so that we cannot be overwhelmed in the scene

**[12:37 - 12:39]** Say hallelujah come and say thank you God

**[12:40 - 12:41]** They are angels

**[12:41 - 12:46]** that are fighting battles in the unseen so that we

**[12:47 - 12:51]** His children may not be overcome in the scene

**[12:52 - 13:00]** Say hallelujah and and and some of those battles are about you about your future about your destiny

**[13:00 - 13:06]** Thank God for the minister of angel powerful powerful worship us. Don't mess with my angel

**[13:07 - 13:10]** So the person next to you don't mess with my angel

**[13:11 - 13:14]** I believe I got at least two so don't mess with my angels

**[13:16 - 13:21]** Because what they have been assigned they are ministering spirits that God has sent

**[13:22 - 13:24]** To take care of me

**[13:26 - 13:27]** Are you hearing me?

**[13:27 - 13:32]** Amen the scripture says in some not the one he has charged them that means he's giving them this order

**[13:32 - 13:38]** It's an assignment to bear us up in their hands so that we would not dash our feet

**[13:40 - 13:47]** Are you hearing me with my stumble and fault they have been charged with that heaven has commanded them as from their present

**[13:49 - 13:51]** Amen

**[13:52 - 13:55]** Is what's this king Sinatra Ritz in the cherub

**[13:56 - 14:00]** Who be decided to mess with with King Hezekiah and Israel

**[14:01 - 14:03]** And threatened to destroy them

**[14:04 - 14:10]** The army that malachites and all about and and and and and King Hezekiah went and prayed

**[14:12 - 14:14]** He

**[14:14 - 14:20]** You know how when you mess with people's children to go to their parents to tell their parents that boy is messing with me

**[14:23 - 14:25]** And then the parents come to your rescue

**[14:27 - 14:30]** Well, this man was threatening to destroy

**[14:31 - 14:32]** Uh

**[14:32 - 14:37]** King Hezekiah and the armies of Israel absolutely and so what did he do? He went to the father

**[14:38 - 14:40]** And he prayed to the god. He said god

**[14:40 - 14:42]** Here with this man is saying

**[14:42 - 14:46]** Here he's saying not god. I want you to show that you are the only true god

**[14:47 - 14:48]** Amen

**[14:48 - 14:50]** Don't allow what he does to prosper

**[14:51 - 14:52]** Come to our rescue

**[14:52 - 14:55]** The bible says that night. Yes, one angel

**[14:57 - 15:00]** How many

**[15:00 - 15:02]** And I said I got at least two

**[15:02 - 15:04]** And when I need more

**[15:04 - 15:06]** They're available

**[15:06 - 15:10]** But just one angel that night got up and went into the aunt the camp and

**[15:11 - 15:13]** one angel that night

**[15:13 - 15:18]** Killed a hundred and six the five thousand soldiers

**[15:19 - 15:22]** just one

**[15:22 - 15:24]** Imagine

**[15:24 - 15:26]** such powerful creatures

**[15:27 - 15:30]** Created by god to serve him. He has charged them

**[15:31 - 15:33]** To minister to you

**[15:35 - 15:37]** As an air

**[15:37 - 15:41]** Of salvation my goodness

**[15:42 - 15:44]** What do these angels do?

**[15:45 - 15:46]** They're worship us, but they're warriors

**[15:47 - 15:49]** And they provide protective services

**[15:52 - 15:54]** protective services

**[15:54 - 15:58]** You think the president of the United States is the only one with secret service

**[16:04 - 16:06]** And then you don't know who you are

**[16:06 - 16:12]** You don't know who whose children you are even the children the president get secret service

**[16:14 - 16:16]** Isn't that so?

**[16:17 - 16:18]** My goodness

**[16:18 - 16:21]** This is not I'm not without preaching for fun this morning

**[16:22 - 16:26]** This is reality

**[16:26 - 16:28]** This is truth every day

**[16:29 - 16:32]** You have angels that god has charged

**[16:33 - 16:37]** To to be with you and to serve you

**[16:37 - 16:42]** And to minister that word to serve of the minister means to render service

**[16:43 - 16:45]** Forb means on your behalf

**[16:47 - 16:49]** So angels

**[16:49 - 16:50]** Have been charged

**[16:50 - 16:55]** To render service on your behalf. You see god has many means by which he blesses us

**[16:56 - 16:58]** He blesses us through his word

**[16:58 - 17:01]** He blesses us by the power of the Holy Spirit

**[17:01 - 17:05]** He blesses us through word another god uses us to help one another

**[17:06 - 17:07]** But I'm

**[17:07 - 17:09]** Want to remind you

**[17:10 - 17:12]** Or inform you

**[17:13 - 17:19]** That one of the prime merit things are ways by which god ministers to us and takes care of us

**[17:19 - 17:25]** Supplies our knees protects us etc is through the ministry of angels

**[17:29 - 17:33]** So what we see taking place in the Christmas story with all of those angels

**[17:33 - 17:38]** That's not a one-off. That's not a something that happened then it doesn't happen anymore

**[17:38 - 17:40]** This stuff

**[17:40 - 17:47]** But you see happening with angels appearing and angels delivering messages and and angels guiding and angels

**[17:47 - 17:51]** Delivering that you see taking place in the Christmas story and in other places scripture

**[17:52 - 17:54]** This is taking place all the time today

**[17:56 - 18:01]** Now when I ask how many of you feel definitely you've had an experience with angels a good number you stood up

**[18:02 - 18:05]** And that's the one or two times you know the angels

**[18:06 - 18:09]** But man they they every day they're busy

**[18:12 - 18:14]** say hallelujah

**[18:14 - 18:20]** So this is not infrequent people we live god created us not to live by ourselves

**[18:20 - 18:24]** But to live in an environment that live in a world that is inhabited by angels

**[18:25 - 18:28]** Who are there with us to help us

**[18:31 - 18:33]** Raise your hands if father this Christmas

**[18:34 - 18:36]** I'm reminded of

**[18:36 - 18:38]** Your love and your provision

**[18:39 - 18:43]** Thank you for the ministry of angels

**[18:46 - 18:47]** Amen

**[18:47 - 18:54]** They they they provide they provide protection they they they actually minister to us in the physically

**[18:54 - 18:57]** Again, we may not when you know, we're not aware of it

**[18:57 - 19:03]** But again look at what happened in the life of Jesus remember when Jesus spent 40 days praying

**[19:03 - 19:07]** The Bible says at the end of the 40 days he was engaging in 10 spiritual warfare

**[19:08 - 19:12]** And he was weary he was tired the Bible says angel's king

**[19:14 - 19:20]** They are sent forth walked to minister to those who are airs of salvation Jesus at that point in time was a man

**[19:20 - 19:25]** In Med he was the father's child, but he was human and he was weak he was tired

**[19:26 - 19:29]** And God sent angels to minister to him

**[19:30 - 19:35]** Now I don't understand all of this stuff because I was I said God why you didn't just speak the word and let Jesus

**[19:36 - 19:38]** Get strengthened

**[19:38 - 19:44]** But he sent angels God created angels and sent angels and those angels attended to him physically

**[19:47 - 19:51]** He was weary physically and they came and strengthen him

**[19:53 - 19:55]** Sometimes when you're weary and tired

**[19:56 - 19:58]** Lift your hand and say thank you God for the minister of angels

**[20:00 - 20:03]** And as you can say God I need the minister of angels right now in the strengthen me

**[20:03 - 20:06]** You don't pray to angels you don't talk to them and command them

**[20:06 - 20:11]** But you talk to the father. He's your father. I'd need now the minister of angels to strengthen me

**[20:13 - 20:18]** Again at the end when he was in the Garden of Cassimony remember how he was again weary wrestling

**[20:18 - 20:23]** And the Bible says what did the God do for him that angels came in minister to him

**[20:24 - 20:26]** The prophet Elijah

**[20:27 - 20:33]** Right Elijah Elijah after that major spiritual battle with the prophets of bail

**[20:33 - 20:39]** came on attack spiritually and he was he was discouraged. She was weak. He

**[20:40 - 20:43]** And and God sent an angel who found him and

**[20:44 - 20:46]** And minister to him physically

**[20:48 - 20:50]** gave him something to eat

**[20:51 - 20:57]** And that whatever it was I don't know whether it was earth the food and if it is we need to discover what that is so we can

**[20:59 - 21:03]** Benefit or whether there was something happening but the angels actually knew he needed food

**[21:03 - 21:05]** He needed physical energy

**[21:06 - 21:11]** And gave him something to eat and the Bible says he became so strong

**[21:11 - 21:15]** He lives on the energy that that thing supplied for how long 40 days

**[21:17 - 21:19]** But an angel did that

**[21:20 - 21:24]** You see God sent them to minister for us to us

**[21:24 - 21:27]** They're real

**[21:27 - 21:29]** You know what I'm saying you hear I'm saying

**[21:30 - 21:32]** They are real and they are present

**[21:33 - 21:37]** In your life they're there and that's during heritage

**[21:38 - 21:41]** Now and the heritage has to be received

**[21:44 - 21:50]** The fact is not everyone enjoys the same level of angelic activity

**[21:52 - 21:56]** Not because not every child of God is entitled

**[21:58 - 22:02]** But what is an inheritance has to be received

**[22:04 - 22:06]** Him and the truth is some of us

**[22:07 - 22:12]** Experience the benefits of these angels and their minister farm more than others

**[22:13 - 22:16]** And it's not because the angels are unwilling

**[22:17 - 22:23]** But it's because many of us are ignorant of the spiritual laws

**[22:25 - 22:28]** That govern the activity of angels you see

**[22:29 - 22:31]** Angels operate legally

**[22:33 - 22:35]** They don't just acts independently

**[22:36 - 22:39]** They don't just do what needs to be done

**[22:40 - 22:42]** They are actually

**[22:42 - 22:45]** Service which means they are under authority

**[22:50 - 22:52]** I hear me

**[22:52 - 22:55]** There are laws that govern their activity

**[22:55 - 23:01]** So those who experience a lot of angelic activity are not more righteous and more holy

**[23:02 - 23:05]** But they are more aligned to the spiritual laws

**[23:06 - 23:09]** That angels obey

**[23:11 - 23:12]** Are you here?

**[23:12 - 23:16]** And angel doesn't know she's crying she's weeping

**[23:16 - 23:18]** And let me go help her that's not how they work

**[23:20 - 23:24]** They're not responding to our tears and not responding to emotions

**[23:26 - 23:28]** What do they respond to go to Psalm 103 20

**[23:31 - 23:33]** Psalm 103 20

**[23:35 - 23:40]** Hallelujah

**[23:40 - 23:42]** Psalm 103 20

**[23:46 - 23:48]** All right

**[23:48 - 23:50]** Looks like we haven't some problems there

**[23:51 - 23:55]** But Psalm 103 verse 20 tells us that the angels

**[23:55 - 23:59]** Harken to the voice of his word

**[23:59 - 24:01]** Let's read that

**[24:01 - 24:02]** Bless the Lord

**[24:02 - 24:06]** You as angels who excel in strength

**[24:07 - 24:09]** Who do his word

**[24:09 - 24:13]** Who heed the voice of his word

**[24:13 - 24:15]** What do angels do

**[24:16 - 24:20]** They heed the voice of his word

**[24:20 - 24:24]** So they don't just do what they want to do

**[24:24 - 24:27]** Or they don't act based upon emotions

**[24:28 - 24:30]** They don't act based upon need

**[24:30 - 24:33]** They are under command

**[24:33 - 24:36]** They are servants of God and they only obey

**[24:38 - 24:40]** the voice

**[24:41 - 24:43]** Of his word not just the word

**[24:44 - 24:45]** But the word spoken

**[24:48 - 24:50]** Because that's the command

**[24:52 - 24:54]** When when we speak the word

**[24:56 - 24:59]** Which angels were created to serve God so that's the only

**[25:00 - 25:03]** Only wonder listening to and getting the commands from

**[25:04 - 25:05]** I hear me

**[25:05 - 25:08]** And so when we're speaking a lot of stuff that

**[25:08 - 25:11]** That it's not aligned

**[25:11 - 25:13]** With the word the angels stand there

**[25:14 - 25:16]** Because if they move on that word

**[25:16 - 25:18]** They will be in disobedience to God

**[25:21 - 25:23]** So they're always listening

**[25:24 - 25:30]** For the voice of his word not his word in the page

**[25:31 - 25:33]** Not his word in your mind

**[25:34 - 25:36]** But the word spoken

**[25:37 - 25:40]** The word spoken creates the legal

**[25:41 - 25:43]** Environments

**[25:43 - 25:47]** And gives the angels the legal authority they need to act

**[25:49 - 25:53]** They may see oh man she needs help but I don't have a word yet I can't move

**[25:57 - 25:58]** Think about army

**[25:58 - 26:00]** Well trained well arms

**[26:01 - 26:03]** And they're ready to move

**[26:03 - 26:05]** But army

**[26:05 - 26:08]** That is well trained knows a responsible orders

**[26:11 - 26:15]** We've got the guns we've got the uh we've got the arms we've got the power we know what we can do

**[26:15 - 26:17]** But we're going to stand here and tell we hear the word

**[26:18 - 26:20]** Somebody got to command us

**[26:21 - 26:23]** Somebody with authority needs to speak

**[26:24 - 26:28]** And when they speak we will move instantly we all have to take sure but until they speak

**[26:29 - 26:33]** We can't do nothing

**[26:33 - 26:35]** I hear me

**[26:35 - 26:41]** And so many of our angels are there watching

**[26:43 - 26:45]** As they can't move

**[26:45 - 26:47]** Because they're waiting

**[26:47 - 26:49]** Not for your tears or mine

**[26:50 - 26:54]** Not for your complaining they don't move because you complain

**[26:57 - 26:59]** They don't move because you cry

**[27:00 - 27:02]** They don't move because they feel sorry for you

**[27:03 - 27:04]** They are an army

**[27:04 - 27:06]** They are servants

**[27:06 - 27:07]** They are an authority

**[27:07 - 27:10]** They need the word of God

**[27:10 - 27:13]** Because that's where they get the legal authority to act

**[27:13 - 27:15]** Until then they have a little legal basis to move

**[27:19 - 27:20]** Hey man, I'm uh

**[27:20 - 27:22]** I have a friend of mine who was

**[27:22 - 27:26]** Who was a student or Roberts and you know, he's from Nigeria and he went back

**[27:26 - 27:29]** Oh, but he came to the states that was sharing with testicles showed us pictures

**[27:29 - 27:33]** How he was on the highway and he lost control of his car and he was going

**[27:34 - 27:38]** I mean there's this tanker and he was going straight under that tanker

**[27:39 - 27:42]** And this is what he said I refuse to die

**[27:45 - 27:47]** That car went under that tanker

**[27:47 - 27:51]** He came out

**[27:51 - 27:55]** Now you may say that was just go into this I say the angels

**[27:56 - 28:00]** heard a word that was in alignment with the word of God

**[28:01 - 28:02]** And when they when he voiced it

**[28:03 - 28:05]** That word

**[28:05 - 28:09]** Became enforceable

**[28:09 - 28:11]** legally

**[28:11 - 28:19]** Are you hear me so those who will experience angelic ministry in his fullness and the benefits of the presence of the angels

**[28:20 - 28:25]** Are those who will create the legal environment in which angels can function freely

**[28:29 - 28:36]** And you create that legal environment by voicing and declaring the word of the Lord

**[28:36 - 28:38]** That's why you have to be careful

**[28:38 - 28:42]** Because if you set up and you say I'm always sick the angels can't enforce that

**[28:44 - 28:46]** They get

**[28:46 - 28:48]** They will stand there and let you be always sick

**[28:50 - 28:52]** Because why it's not it's not the word of the Lord

**[28:53 - 29:00]** So they have no legal authority in the truth and now demons like would love for you to say you know demons are also angels just

**[29:02 - 29:04]** And the spiritual world operates similarly

**[29:05 - 29:09]** So you gotta otherwise those ain't those demons and you do so with your words

**[29:11 - 29:16]** You go to sleep and you have a dream and the dream you eat something or whatever somebody's chasing you

**[29:17 - 29:19]** You get up and you say the devil is after me

**[29:20 - 29:24]** The people are trying to put a put witchcraft on me

**[29:25 - 29:27]** And it's my grandmother you know what you're doing

**[29:28 - 29:31]** You are with your word giving life to that curse

**[29:34 - 29:39]** And with that word you're creating the legal environment for demons so enforce it

**[29:40 - 29:42]** The angels can't help you there but the demons can

**[29:45 - 29:48]** The demons are not submitted to God's word so they don't need God's word

**[29:49 - 29:56]** They will obey yours

**[29:56 - 29:57]** man

**[29:57 - 30:03]** So one of the laws that govern angelic activity is that angels that are present

**[30:04 - 30:10]** Will not be moved by our emotions by our tears the other thing that moves them is the word of God

**[30:10 - 30:12]** But that word must be voiced

**[30:15 - 30:20]** So that armistens and that army will do nothing until somebody who has the authority

**[30:21 - 30:27]** To command those officers will get to command and then they will go into effect angels are like that

**[30:27 - 30:34]** They wait for the legal authorities to act and the legal authority is granted that when one who is an heir

**[30:35 - 30:37]** Speaks the word

**[30:37 - 30:42]** Of God and when you voice it. Ah, I have a legal authority now to enforce it

**[30:45 - 30:48]** So when you say the Lord is my refuge and my fortress

**[30:49 - 30:52]** Uh-huh the angels have the legal authority to enforce that

**[30:53 - 30:57]** Amen when you say no weapon form against me will prosper

**[30:57 - 31:04]** Ah, that's the word of the Lord the angels now have the authority the legal authority to enforce it

**[31:05 - 31:08]** When you say my god to supply all my needs

**[31:08 - 31:10]** According to his riches in glory

**[31:10 - 31:15]** Guess what the angels now have the authority to go and find whatever it is that you're going to need

**[31:15 - 31:20]** Because you have created a legal environment that allows them to function

**[31:20 - 31:25]** Are you listening to me

**[31:26 - 31:28]** Some of us were confusing our angels

**[31:30 - 31:32]** We said this with it

**[31:33 - 31:35]** What do you want me to do

**[31:36 - 31:39]** Speak consistently speak the word of the Lord

**[31:42 - 31:46]** So so angels are present but you can have a lot of money in the back

**[31:46 - 31:48]** And then I know what draws me me

**[31:51 - 31:53]** And some of us have a have a angelic balance

**[31:54 - 31:59]** In our account that is not being used when I withdrawing it because we're not giving the voice

**[31:59 - 32:01]** We're not giving God's word the voice

**[32:03 - 32:07]** We're not speaking it. So here's what I'm saying speak God's word

**[32:08 - 32:11]** Declare take some not at one and every day

**[32:14 - 32:18]** Speak some not at one

**[32:18 - 32:26]** Take those promises of God what Christ has done and every day speak in alignment those who are seeing the angelic

**[32:27 - 32:31]** Ministry in a greater way are doing so not because they're more holy and more righteous

**[32:32 - 32:39]** But because they are more in alignment they align with the spiritual law that angels obey

**[32:43 - 32:48]** So one of the ways that you're going to increase angelic activity in your life is where you open your mouth

**[32:48 - 32:54]** And you're going to declare on a consistent basis you're going to voice the word resist the temptation to think you know what

**[32:55 - 32:58]** A lot of these thoughts as say John put in your minds will die

**[32:59 - 33:03]** And never become a reality if you never give them life with your words

**[33:04 - 33:06]** The Bible says death and life are in the power of the top

**[33:09 - 33:14]** So say John puts a thought in your mind and then waits for you to give life to it with your words

**[33:17 - 33:20]** Don't give life to those fears and anxieties

**[33:20 - 33:25]** Open your mouth and declare the word of God because that we give life

**[33:26 - 33:31]** To God's will and God's purposes in your life and angels stand to enforce that

**[33:33 - 33:37]** That's why they're here. There's service of God sent to enforce God's will in your life

**[33:37 - 33:44]** But they're waiting for you who are an heir of God to give voice to that word to that will so they can execute it

**[33:44 - 33:46]** As God has determined for them to do

**[33:48 - 33:50]** Here's another thing that is so critical

**[33:51 - 33:56]** It may be the difference between why one person is experiencing the benefits of angelic

**[33:57 - 33:59]** The other is prayer

**[34:01 - 34:06]** Listen to me listen to what listen to what Jesus said listen to what Jesus said what Jesus was on the cross

**[34:07 - 34:09]** What Jesus was on the cross

**[34:09 - 34:11]** What did Jesus say concerning angels

**[34:14 - 34:16]** Amen

**[34:16 - 34:25]** What Jesus would be inclusive when they were beating him when they're resting him before he got to the cross and they and and and what was a Peter who took the

**[34:26 - 34:28]** The sword and cut off the ear of

**[34:30 - 34:32]** Whoever came to arrest him

**[34:32 - 34:34]** Jesus said Peter

**[34:34 - 34:38]** Don't you know? I'm a son

**[34:38 - 34:40]** Angels are created to serve

**[34:42 - 34:44]** Don't you know I can ask the father

**[34:45 - 34:47]** right now

**[34:47 - 34:49]** And the father will send me

**[34:49 - 34:50]** 12

**[34:50 - 34:52]** legions

**[34:52 - 34:54]** I think there's six thousand in one legion

**[34:54 - 34:56]** so that's seventy two

**[34:57 - 34:59]** thousand

**[35:00 - 35:04]** Jesus said presently right now I asked and right now they will show up so they were ready

**[35:04 - 35:08]** There was seventy two thousand angel just waiting for the command

**[35:12 - 35:15]** He says I can ask right now and seventy two thousand will come

**[35:17 - 35:19]** The father will send them

**[35:19 - 35:21]** But if you notice

**[35:21 - 35:23]** none of those angels came

**[35:24 - 35:28]** Not one

**[35:28 - 35:29]** seventy two thousand were ready

**[35:30 - 35:32]** not one showed up

**[35:33 - 35:35]** They stood there and Jesus was arrested

**[35:36 - 35:38]** They took him to the cross they crucified him

**[35:39 - 35:42]** Even though they were ready once if they had gotten the word

**[35:43 - 35:45]** They would have moved

**[35:45 - 35:47]** Jesus would not have gone to the cross

**[35:48 - 35:52]** We would not have been saved so Jesus says let the angels say this one

**[35:53 - 35:54]** I want to face it

**[35:54 - 35:59]** I want to go through the suffering. I'm not asking for rescue from this one because I got to go to that cross

**[35:59 - 36:03]** I got to die. I got to pay that price so they can be delivered so father

**[36:03 - 36:08]** I'm not I'm not going to ask for the angels because I know right now if I ask

**[36:08 - 36:10]** instantly

**[36:10 - 36:12]** They will show up

**[36:12 - 36:14]** Show that angels are ready to act

**[36:15 - 36:16]** At this

**[36:16 - 36:19]** At a moment's notice

**[36:19 - 36:21]** But why didn't they move?

**[36:22 - 36:24]** There's one explanation

**[36:24 - 36:29]** Jesus didn't ask

**[36:29 - 36:33]** Why is it that angels are there and they sometimes don't move

**[36:35 - 36:37]** Because prayer

**[36:37 - 36:41]** Hasn't been made

**[36:41 - 36:44]** So the angels will respond to the word that you declare

**[36:45 - 36:47]** And angels respond to prayer

**[36:48 - 36:50]** Based on that word

**[36:50 - 36:56]** And so the more we pray based upon the word and the more we back up a prayer

**[36:56 - 37:04]** We're declaring the word the more angelic activity we will personally experience in our lives

**[37:06 - 37:08]** I hear me

**[37:08 - 37:11]** So no prayer

**[37:11 - 37:13]** Well, it looks like no

**[37:14 - 37:15]** angelic

**[37:15 - 37:22]** ministry not because angelic ministry is not available. You got 72,000 angels that could be released right now

**[37:24 - 37:26]** But the prayer faith

**[37:26 - 37:32]** Isn't being prayed and the word of God isn't being spoken

**[37:33 - 37:35]** And so they stand

**[37:35 - 37:37]** While you cry

**[37:38 - 37:40]** It's not that they're not moved

**[37:40 - 37:42]** But they cannot act

**[37:42 - 37:44]** Unless they act legally

**[37:45 - 37:49]** And it takes your believing prayer and it takes the word of God in your mouth

**[37:50 - 37:52]** being spoken

**[37:52 - 37:56]** For you to create the legal conditions that allow them to function freely

**[37:56 - 37:59]** Frequently fully in your life

**[37:59 - 38:01]** I encourage you

**[38:01 - 38:03]** Begin to do so

**[38:04 - 38:11]** Amen

**[38:11 - 38:13]** Daniel in Daniel chapter 10

**[38:14 - 38:17]** Daniel took the word of God and went to God in prayer

**[38:18 - 38:20]** And the scripture says that

**[38:21 - 38:24]** Daniel kept standing kept believing for 21 days

**[38:24 - 38:26]** And then the angel of the Lord showed up

**[38:27 - 38:29]** And the angel said the minute

**[38:30 - 38:32]** As soon as you open your mouth, I was dispatched

**[38:33 - 38:36]** Again, I'm showing you the connection between the words spoken

**[38:37 - 38:40]** Prayer based on the word a high angels respond

**[38:40 - 38:43]** But that prayer and that word have to be

**[38:43 - 38:46]** You keep your mouth silent and angels will be still

**[38:50 - 38:54]** So I want to encourage you don't don't don't don't don't be silent

**[38:56 - 38:59]** Open your mouth but when you open your mouth make sure

**[39:00 - 39:06]** You are voicing the word of the Lord so that the angels can provide the level of existence that

**[39:06 - 39:10]** Is required and that God wants them to deliver on your behalf

**[39:13 - 39:14]** You hear me

**[39:14 - 39:19]** So as we go into this Christmas and we go beyond into next year

**[39:20 - 39:21]** Don't don't don't believe the lie

**[39:22 - 39:24]** That you are you are under source

**[39:26 - 39:29]** Don't don't believe the lie that you are alone

**[39:30 - 39:33]** You know don't believe the lie that there's nobody to help you

**[39:35 - 39:38]** No, no, no all of that will keep your angels at attention

**[39:39 - 39:45]** But when you fill your heart and you fill your mind and you fill your mouth with the reality that angels are there

**[39:46 - 39:48]** And you consciously

**[39:48 - 39:49]** begin to

**[39:49 - 39:52]** thank God for them and voice

**[39:53 - 39:55]** What God has said concerning you

**[39:56 - 40:03]** You will see the angelic activity in your life increasing and then you know what's done. So I'm recognizing and acknowledging it

**[40:05 - 40:08]** And let me end with this angels won't want to do big things

**[40:09 - 40:14]** I mean in terms of the protective services. I you let me get you one story that I'm done

**[40:15 - 40:17]** maybe two

**[40:17 - 40:19]** But you know they're protecting us all the time

**[40:19 - 40:24]** But you know most of the time we don't know what they're protecting us from but there are few things that uh this one

**[40:25 - 40:29]** And I shared with you recently how I I'm convinced that we were delivered from the accident

**[40:29 - 40:31]** Well, there was another accident

**[40:31 - 40:35]** Better years ago that I was safe from and I am absolutely

**[40:36 - 40:40]** 100% once convinced I was protected by my angel

**[40:42 - 40:44]** Because I had started to drive

**[40:45 - 40:50]** But I wasn't I didn't have a lot of experience yet in driving and so I was coming

**[40:52 - 40:58]** From Orabas University coming off the campus and I'm about to pull into Georgia Avenue

**[40:59 - 41:01]** I was Georgia. I don't know. What's some other name

**[41:02 - 41:04]** Louis Avenue Louis Avenue

**[41:04 - 41:09]** And that was a major street and and and and and and traffic the people

**[41:09 - 41:10]** generally

**[41:10 - 41:12]** travel quite fast there

**[41:12 - 41:15]** And I did not look you know new driver

**[41:18 - 41:20]** I didn't look left and right and left

**[41:22 - 41:26]** That's why you're supposed to do right right left no left right left

**[41:27 - 41:33]** I didn't do that and I was about to pull my car directly onto Louis Avenue

**[41:35 - 41:37]** And I tell you that car wouldn't move

**[41:39 - 41:42]** It was like somebody stood before the car and say you're not going anywhere

**[41:43 - 41:44]** I'm the the car did this

**[41:45 - 41:49]** I'm telling this car like I must have been traveling 67 miles per hour

**[41:52 - 41:52]** two seconds

**[41:53 - 41:55]** And that guy would have jawbone

**[41:56 - 41:58]** I wouldn't be a passenger here today

**[41:59 - 42:02]** Don't tell me there wasn't an angel there

**[42:03 - 42:09]** Protecting me

**[42:09 - 42:11]** They do big things

**[42:11 - 42:13]** It's scripture as you see them

**[42:13 - 42:16]** Doing some powerful things like shutting the mouth of the lion

**[42:17 - 42:19]** But they also do small things too

**[42:20 - 42:22]** They're here to minister

**[42:22 - 42:26]** So the other day when I was coming back from Liberia I was at the airport in Togo

**[42:27 - 42:28]** Was it Togo? Yeah

**[42:28 - 42:32]** Just sitting down and resting and not paying attention

**[42:34 - 42:35]** And the plane was about to take off

**[42:39 - 42:43]** Seriously, I I don't know what I was that I didn't even look after my wash

**[42:43 - 42:46]** So even I was just sitting there relaxing

**[42:47 - 42:48]** And then I just felt get up

**[42:49 - 42:51]** Because I don't know I just stood again

**[42:51 - 42:54]** I didn't get up because I was thinking I was late

**[42:54 - 42:57]** I just got up and started to stroll

**[42:57 - 42:59]** And as soon as I got up somebody the guy was

**[42:59 - 43:01]** I even said Johnson we're looking for we're looking for you

**[43:05 - 43:07]** Don't tell me it wasn't an angel

**[43:07 - 43:10]** I said my man you better get up the plane is about to

**[43:13 - 43:15]** Raise your hands if father thank you

**[43:16 - 43:19]** For the minutes of angels I'm never alone

**[43:21 - 43:23]** I'm never on the source

**[43:23 - 43:26]** We thank you that angels

**[43:27 - 43:29]** minister

**[43:29 - 43:31]** On our behalf

**[43:31 - 43:33]** We will

**[43:33 - 43:35]** Not be silent

**[43:35 - 43:37]** We will

**[43:37 - 43:39]** Voice your word

**[43:40 - 43:42]** We will

**[43:42 - 43:44]** Give them the legal authority

**[43:45 - 43:47]** To work in our lives

**[43:47 - 43:48]** We will

**[43:48 - 43:54]** Create the legal environment that allows them to function freely

**[43:54 - 43:56]** In Jesus name

**[43:56 - 43:58]** And everybody said

**[43:58 - 44:00]** Amen and everybody said

**[44:03 - 44:05]** Now as great as angels are

**[44:08 - 44:10]** There's one far greater

**[44:10 - 44:13]** Thank God for angels for your greatest gift

**[44:14 - 44:16]** is Jesus

**[44:16 - 44:18]** And before him angels bar

**[44:19 - 44:22]** Learn from the angels to bar

**[44:23 - 44:24]** Before him

**[44:24 - 44:26]** In Jesus name

**[44:26 - 44:29]** Amen and amen God bless you. Thank you

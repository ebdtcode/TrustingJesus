## SERMON SUMMARY

Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivers a penetrating message on the critical distinction between authentic and counterfeit worship using the Christmas narrative of the wise men and King Herod. In our contemporary culture where "fake" has become commonplace—fake news, fake signs, fake prophets—the Bishop addresses the most consequential form of fakeness: fake worship. Unlike other forms of deception that may or may not matter, whether worship is real or fake is absolutely critical because we are dealing with eternal things.

The central thesis is powerful and uncompromising: The revelation of Jesus as King always demands a response, and that response will determine whether we are fake or real in our worship. The father seeks worshipers who will worship Him in spirit and in truth, and this sermon provides a biblical framework to test our hearts and evaluate the authenticity of our worship.

The sermon examines two radically different responses to the same message about the same King. The wise men and Herod both heard that Jesus, the King of the Jews, was born. Same revelation, same message, but two completely different responses—both called worship. One response was joyful and led to surrender, giving, and transformation. The other was characterized by fear and led to resistance, pretense, and destruction.

**The Model of Real Worship: The Wise Men**

The wise men demonstrate what genuine worship looks like. First, their worship began with hunger—a genuine, serious hunger to know, meet, and discover the King. They weren't casual seekers or merely being religious; they were genuinely hungry for the revelation of Jesus Christ. They left Persia and made an extraordinarily long journey because they wanted to meet Him personally and know Him personally, not just hear about Him secondhand.

Second, this hunger gave rise to pursuit. When you truly see Jesus, every encounter makes you want to see Him more. The wise men saw His star among countless other stars in the heavens, but they focused exclusively on that one star, ignoring everything else. In a world full of distractions—ambitions, goals, dreams, relationships, money, status—real worshipers fix their eyes on Jesus. Where your focus is reveals the reality of your worship.

Third, they pursued Jesus at great cost. The journey from Persia was long, expensive, and inconvenient, but nothing was too much and no price was too great. True worshipers are willing to reorder their entire lives around the revelation of the King. People who don't know Jesus have an excuse for their priorities, but those who have received the revelation of who He is will reorder everything—time, treasure, relationships, career—to reflect that He is the one they live for, worship, and seek after.

Fourth, they brought their gifts and worshiped Him with their treasures. They didn't come empty-handed; they honored Him with their substance—gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Jesus said, "Where your treasure is, that's where your heart is going to be." Our whole life is to be a gift to Jesus because He gave His whole life for us. True worship is reasonable service: presenting our bodies as living sacrifices because He gave Himself completely for us.

Finally, the defining mark of their worship was surrender. When they found Jesus, they bowed down. They surrendered themselves and their substance, placing everything at His feet as if to say, "These no longer belong to us—they are Yours. You are King, we're not. You are Lord, we're not. You're the star, we're not." Anything short of surrender comes short of worship. May Christ bring us to that place of surrender where we trust Him enough to truly lay everything down at His feet.

**The Model of Fake Worship: King Herod**

Herod represents the fake worshiper, and his response reveals critical characteristics of counterfeit worship. First, when Herod heard the news concerning Jesus, he was troubled—not joyful, not excited, not glad, but troubled. Fake worshipers have a real problem with Jesus's kingship and lordship. They love to hear that Jesus is Savior, Healer, and Forgiver; they love hearing that Jesus will bless and help them. But when the message emphasizes that Jesus is King, it troubles them because they understand what kingship demands: surrender of themselves.

Acknowledging Jesus as King means abdicating the throne of their own lives, which they've been sitting on all their lives. It means they can no longer be "the decider in chief." They must now listen to Him and be accountable to Him, to His Word, and even to the church. Fake worshipers struggle with the issue of control. They want to serve Him to a degree but cannot advocate their rights to make their own decisions or reserve some things for themselves.

Second, Herod inquired and wanted information, but he never intended for that information to transform him. He wanted information that would empower him to continue doing what he wanted to do. The desire for information without the willingness for transformation is a clear indication of fake worship. Real worshipers bow and surrender, inviting Jesus to have His way, which means any information received is used to produce change and transformation. If you want to remain the same and simply want information, you are not a real worshiper. True worship requires willingness for the information we receive to produce transformation in our lives.

Third, Herod delegated the hard work of worship to others. He told the wise men, "You go do the hard work—spend the time, invest the energy, make the effort, seek Him—and when you find Him, come tell me so I can worship too." Fake worshipers don't want to experience the hard parts of worship; they only worship when they can do so without much effort or time. They want worship quick, sweet, and easy on the flesh. When it requires a price—time to pray, read, fast, wait upon the Lord—they delegate that to others. Real worshipers spend the time and pay the price to get into the Word, to spend time with God, to study, and to let God's Word penetrate from head to heart.

Fourth, Herod worshiped only because others were doing it—he said he would worship "too." Many fake worshipers only worship because they're part of the crowd. As long as the crowd is doing it, you'll see them, but they're just going with what's popular. They don't have a personal relationship or personal convictions; they're not motivated from within. When friends leave the church or stop serving the Lord, they follow suit because it's more about being in the crowd than having a real personal relationship with Christ.

Finally, Herod was simply pretending. He said, "I will come and worship," but had no intention of worshiping—his true agenda was to kill the child. Many people worship in churches but are really only pretending. They may be worshiping fame, popularity, power, possessions, or most of all, themselves. Jesus said, "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me." True worship will be demonstrated in our works of obedience.

**The Core Issue: Worship Without Surrender is Management**

The Bishop delivers the devastating conclusion: worship without surrendering is simply an attempt to manage God. Worship without surrender is not worship at all. We sing, pray, and attend church, but we still keep control. We're still on the throne. We want God, but we don't want Him close enough to confront us or change us—we want Him only close enough to bless us. That's pretending to worship.

When worship is really management, we're saying, "God, I want to manage You. God, bless my plans, but don't change them. God, heal me, but don't touch this part. God, speak to me, but don't speak to me about this." When we worship without surrendering, we have made God a consultant, not the King. We consult Him on matters we think we need His advice on, but we take care of other matters in the way we have deemed correct.

The truth we must face: You cannot worship the person you're trying to manage. You can either bow and surrender to God, or you can try to negotiate with Him. But God does not negotiate His kingship.

**The Three-Part Invitation**

The sermon concludes with a clear, actionable invitation:
1. Stop trying to manage God (that's fake worship)
2. Step off the throne—He is King (that's real worship)
3. Lay down control at His feet and trust Him (that's real worship)

Worship is not measured by how loudly we sing but by how deeply we surrender. Jesus is both a great King who deserves our surrender and a humble, servant King who rules with grace and mercy. He loves us more than we love ourselves, so we can surrender to Him because He is trustworthy. The revelation of Jesus as King demands our response—not debate, not delay, but surrender.

## PRAYER POINTS BASED ON THE SERMON

### 1. Prayer for Genuine Hunger for Jesus

**Focus:** Cultivating a deep, personal hunger to know Christ, not just know about Him

**Prayer:** Father God, I come before You asking for a genuine hunger for Jesus that goes beyond religious formality. Like the wise men who left Persia and traveled far to meet the King, give me a heart that is not satisfied with secondhand information about Jesus. I don't want to be a casual seeker; I want to be a serious seeker hungry for truth. According to John 14:6, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. I pray that my desire for worship would be motivated by a real hunger to meet Him personally, to know Him personally, and to experience Him for myself. Holy Spirit, stir up within me an insatiable appetite for the presence of Jesus. Let me never become complacent or satisfied with where I am in my relationship with Him. Every encounter with Jesus should make me hunger for more. Fill me with the same passionate pursuit that characterized the wise men, willing to go to any length and pay any price to find Him.

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:2 - "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him." John 14:6 - "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.'"

### 2. Prayer for Focused Pursuit of Jesus Above All Distractions

**Focus:** Fixing our eyes on Jesus and ignoring the countless distractions competing for our attention

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, in a world with countless "stars"—ambitions, goals, dreams, relationships, money, status—help me to identify Your star and focus exclusively on You. The wise men saw many stars in the heavens, but they ignored all the others when they identified His star. That became the only star they cared about. Father, I confess that I have allowed many things to absorb my attention, absorb my life, and become the focus of everything I do. Today I choose to fix my eyes on Jesus. According to Hebrews 12:2, let me run this race with my eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith. May my eyes become so focused on You that none of the other things trying to grab my attention have any power over me. When I fix my eyes on You, it brings peace; when I fix my eyes on You, it brings hope; when I fix my eyes on You, it brings power and true fulfillment. Where is my focus? Lord, let it be on You and on those things that lead me closer and closer to You.

**Scripture:** Hebrews 12:1-2 - "Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." Matthew 6:21 - "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

### 3. Prayer for Complete Surrender of Control

**Focus:** Abdicating the throne of our lives and surrendering every area to Christ's lordship

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, I acknowledge that the defining mark of true worship is surrender. When the wise men found Jesus, they bowed down. According to Romans 12:1-2, I present my body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to You, which is my reasonable service. Lord, I confess that there are areas of my life where I have been troubled by Your kingship because I know it demands that I surrender control. Like Herod, I have loved hearing that You are Savior, Healer, and Forgiver, but I have struggled when confronted with Your lordship. Today, I choose to abdicate the throne of my life. I am not the decider in chief—You are. I surrender my time, my treasure, my gifts, my finances, my marriage, my relationships, my career—every single area. They no longer belong to me; they are Yours. You are King; I'm not. You are Lord; I'm not. Do with me and do with these as You will. I trust You enough to lay everything down at Your feet because You are not only a great King deserving of my surrender, but also a humble, servant King who loves me more than I love myself.

**Scripture:** Romans 12:1 - "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service." Matthew 2:11 - "And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him."

### 4. Prayer for Willingness to Pay the Price of True Worship

**Focus:** Being willing to invest time, effort, and resources in pursuit of Jesus

**Prayer:** Lord, I recognize that true worshipers are willing to pay a price in pursuit of You. The wise men traveled far, followed long, and kept going even when it was inconvenient. It cost them time, money, and effort to go from Persia to where Jesus was, but nothing was too much and no price was too great for them to pay. Father, forgive me for the times I have wanted worship to be quick, sweet, and easy on the flesh. Forgive me for delegating the hard parts of worship to others—letting the preacher study while I just show up, hoping to reap benefits without effort. Today I commit to being a real worshiper who will spend the time and pay the price to get into Your Word, to spend time with You in prayer, to fast, and to wait upon You. I will not set limits on what I would do, how far I would go, or how much I would give in pursuit of You. Help me to reorder my priorities around the revelation of who You are—the one I live for, the one I worship, the one I seek after.

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:1-2 - The wise men's long journey from the East. Matthew 6:21 - "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

### 5. Prayer for Transformation, Not Just Information

**Focus:** Allowing God's Word to produce change in our lives, not just fill our heads with knowledge

**Prayer:** Father God, I confess that like Herod, there have been times when I inquired and wanted information about You, but I never truly intended for that information to transform me. I wanted knowledge that would empower me to continue doing what I wanted to do. Today I repent of this fake worship. According to Romans 12:2, I ask You to transform me by the renewing of my mind. Real worshipers bow and surrender, inviting You to have Your way, which means any information we receive is used to produce change and transformation in our lives. I don't want to remain the same. I don't want to come to church weekly, get information, but refuse transformation because I love where I am and what I'm doing. Lord, I want to change more and more into the image of Christ. Help me not just to get information, but to let the information concerning Jesus produce transformation. Through meditation on Your Word, let it get from my head to my heart, and from my heart to my hands and habits. Change me, Lord, from glory to glory.

**Scripture:** Romans 12:2 - "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind." James 1:22 - "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."

### 6. Prayer to Stop Managing God and Start Worshiping Him

**Focus:** Ending attempts to control God and surrendering to His complete authority

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, Your Word confronts me with a powerful truth: worship without surrender is simply an attempt to manage You. I confess that I have been guilty of trying to manage You instead of worship You. I have said, "God, bless my plans, but don't change them. God, heal me, but don't touch this part. God, speak to me, but don't speak to me about this." I have wanted You close enough to bless me but not close enough to confront me or change me. In doing so, I have made You a consultant instead of recognizing You as King. Lord, I cannot worship the person I'm trying to manage. Today I stop negotiating with You because You do not negotiate Your kingship. I choose to bow and surrender to You. I step off the throne of my life because You are King. I lay down control at Your feet and trust You completely. I acknowledge that You are the decider in chief in every area of my life. Let my worship be measured not by how loudly I sing, but by how deeply I surrender.

**Scripture:** John 4:23-24 - "But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him." Matthew 2:11 - "They fell down and worshiped Him."

---

### 7. Prayer for Personal Conviction, Not Crowd-Following

**Focus:** Developing a genuine personal relationship with Christ beyond social influence

**Prayer:** Lord Jesus, I don't want to be like those who worship only because others are doing it—those who are part of the crowd but have no personal relationship or personal convictions. Herod said he would worship "too," but had no real intention. Father, I want my worship to flow from deep personal conviction and intimate relationship with You, not from what's popular or who's around me. I confess that there have been times when my church attendance, my service, and my devotion were more about being in the crowd than about genuinely pursuing You. I don't want my friends' decisions to determine my faithfulness. Whether anyone else worships or not, whether friends stay or leave, whether it's popular or not, let me worship You because I know You personally and am motivated from within by the Holy Spirit. Give me the strength to stand alone if necessary, to worship in spirit and in truth regardless of the crowd.

**Scripture:** John 4:23-24 - "True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth." Matthew 2:8 - "That I may come and worship Him too" (Herod's pretense).

---

### 8. Prayer for Obedience That Demonstrates Love

**Focus:** Moving from lip service to genuine obedience as the proof of worship

**Prayer:** Father, Jesus declared in Matthew 15:8, "These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me." I don't want to be guilty of honoring You with words, songs, music, and dance while my heart remains far from You. Jesus also said in John 14:15, "If you love Me, keep My commandments." True worship will be demonstrated in my works of obedience. According to James 2:18, I will show my faith by my works. Lord, if I'm truly worshiping You, I will be loving others. Your commandment is that we love one another. How can I say I love You whom I've never seen if I don't love my neighbor who I have seen? Expose any pretense in my worship. Let my worship be real, flowing from my heart and evidenced in my obedience, my love for others, and my works of righteousness. I don't want to worship You with just words; I want to worship You with my whole life—heart, works, obedience, and love.

**Scripture:** John 14:15 - "If you love Me, keep My commandments." Matthew 15:8 - "These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me." 1 John 4:20 - "If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar." James 2:18 - "Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."

### 9. Prayer for Honoring God with Substance and Treasures

**Focus:** Worshiping God with our material resources, not just words

**Prayer:** Lord, the wise men didn't come to Jesus empty-handed. They brought their gifts and worshiped Him with their treasures—gold, frankincense, and myrrh. This was a reflection of the reality of their hearts. They honored You with their substance. Jesus, You said in Matthew 6:21, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." I recognize that our whole life is to be a gift to You because You gave Your whole life for us. You didn't just take a portion of Yourself and give it to us; You gave Yourself completely and totally. Anyone who would do that deserves a response from us that is no less than offering ourselves completely to Him. Father, I present my body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to You. I honor You not just in December with "gifts for the King," but every day of my life with the gift of my surrendered heart, my time, my talents, and my treasures. Let me place them all at Your feet, acknowledging they no longer belong to me but are Yours to use for Your glory.

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:11 - "When they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh." Matthew 6:21 - "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Romans 12:1 - "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God."

### 10. Prayer for Reordering Life Priorities Around Christ's Kingship

**Focus:** Restructuring every aspect of life to reflect Jesus as King and Lord

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, I understand that people who don't know Jesus have an excuse for living the way they do and the priorities they make—they don't know Him. But I who know You, I who have seen You, I who know and believe that You are the King—the revelation of who You are must cause me to reorder my priorities. There is one set of priorities I had before I met Christ, but now that I've met Him, my priorities must be reordered to reflect that You are the one I live for, the one I worship, the one I seek after. Your will is what I want done in my life. Help me to reorder my life around the revelation of Your kingship. You are the decider in chief over my relationships, my finances, my career, my time—over every aspect of my life. Let Your will be done and Your purpose be accomplished. I claim the grace to walk in this revelation at every point, with every decision, with every choice I make. I will remember that You are the King of kings, and I surrender everything to Your lordship.

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:1-2 - The wise men reordered their lives to pursue the King. Romans 12:2 - "That you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."

### 11. Prayer for Distinguishing Between Jesus as Savior and Jesus as King

**Focus:** Embracing both the salvation and the lordship of Christ

**Prayer:** Lord, I thank You that You are my Savior—You have forgiven my sins, healed my diseases, and blessed my life. But I also acknowledge that You are King and Lord. I confess that it's easy to embrace You as Savior but difficult to surrender to You as King because kingship demands accountability, surrender, and obedience. Forgive me for the times I've wanted salvation without submission, forgiveness without authority, heaven without obedience, and grace without lordship. Today I declare that Jesus is both my Savior and my King. I will not be troubled by Your kingship like Herod was. Instead, I will rejoice like the wise men who, when they saw Your star, "rejoiced with exceedingly great joy." I accept that if You are King, certain things must stop and other things must begin. Some things that I enjoy must be laid down, and some things I don't particularly care for—like loving my neighbors and forgiving my enemies—must be embraced. You are King, and I bow before Your throne.

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:2 - "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?" Matthew 2:3 - "When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled." Matthew 2:10 - "When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy."

### 12. Prayer for a Church of Real Worshipers

**Focus:** Corporate transformation into a body of genuine, surrendered worshipers

**Prayer:** Father God, I pray not only for myself but for the entire body of Christ. You are seeking worshipers who will worship You in spirit and in truth. Let our churches become filled with real worshipers, not fake ones. Let us be like the wise men—hungry, focused, pursuing at great cost, surrendering completely—rather than like Herod—troubled by lordship, seeking information without transformation, delegating worship, following the crowd, and pretending. According to Psalm 1:1-3, let us be like trees planted by rivers of water, stable and unmovable, bringing forth fruit in every season, with leaves that never wither, prospering in whatever we do because we delight in Your law and meditate in it day and night. Transform our churches into communities of genuine worshipers who have stepped off the throne, stopped trying to manage You, and laid down control at Your feet. Let our worship be measured not by how loudly we sing but by how deeply we surrender. May we be a people who worship You in spirit and in truth.

**Scripture:** John 4:23 - "The Father is seeking such to worship Him." Psalm 1:1-3 - "Blessed is the man... whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water."

## CONCLUSION

This powerful sermon confronts every believer with the essential question: Is my worship real or fake? The answer is not found in religious activity, emotional experiences, or church attendance, but in the response to Jesus's kingship. True worship demands complete surrender—laying down control, abdicating the throne of our lives, and allowing Jesus to be the decider in chief in every area.

The wise men set the model: genuine hunger for Jesus, focused pursuit despite distractions, willingness to pay any price, honoring Him with treasures, and complete surrender demonstrated by bowing down. Herod represents the warning: being troubled by lordship, seeking information without transformation, delegating the hard work, following the crowd, and pretending to worship while pursuing a hidden agenda.

The invitation is clear and urgent:
1. Stop trying to manage God
2. Step off the throne—He is King
3. Lay down control at His feet and trust Him

Worship is not measured by how loudly we sing but by how deeply we surrender. Jesus is both a great King deserving of our worship and a humble, servant King who loves us more than we love ourselves. We can trust Him with complete surrender because He is trustworthy.

The time for pretense is over. The call is to genuine, authentic, transformative worship that flows from a surrendered heart, is evidenced by obedient works, and brings glory to the King of kings.

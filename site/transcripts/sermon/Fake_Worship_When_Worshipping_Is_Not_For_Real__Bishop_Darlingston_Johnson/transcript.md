All right. Let's go to the Word. We're in what we call the Christmas season. And so I want us to look at Matthew chapter 2 1 through 12 because I wanted to speak to you out of that very familiar passage related to the birth of Jesus. And this passage has to do with the worship of what we call the wise men. And also the response of Herod to the news concerning Jesus. You know we we live in a at a time now when the word fake if a key has risen to a new level. Amen. Now it's you know fake news and fake signs and fake reporters and what else? Uh? Fake prophets and and on and on. So we use the word fake a lot right now. And a lot of things now is difficult to determine is it true or is it fake? There were a time when we accepted everything and if it wasn't true we would say it's false but now we say it's fake. So fake is the new false right? And so today you know I want to talk about the fake and the real because there's fake worship and there's real worship. And while all of these other fake this and fake that may or may not be important most certainly whether worship is real or fake is absolutely critical because at this point you're dealing with eternal things. Amen. And I believe the story recorded here of the wise men and Herod and their response to Jesus gives us an opening for us to begin to consider and get some insights into what is fake worship and what is real worship because we know the father is seeking people who will worship him in spirit and in truth. The father wants some real worshipers and we don't want to be among those who are fake. Hallelujah. So here is the big idea. The revelation of Jesus as king always demands a response and that response will determine whether we are fake or real in terms of our worship. So let's quickly read the story. Let's stand very quickly. I'm going to be referring to this story and so let's really get in our mind. So when I make reference you know you saw it in the passage together we'll read it out. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying where is he who has been born king of the Jews but we have seen his star in the east and I've come to worship him when Herod the king heard this he was what troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he inquired say inquired of them where the Christ was to be born next verse so they said to him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet amen say thus it is written but you Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the rulers of Judah for out of you shall come a ruler who was shepherd by people Israel say thank God for Jesus. Hallelujah then Herod when he had secretly called the wise men determined from them what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search carefully for the young child and when you have found him bring back words to me that I become and worship him also I think the king James versions that worship him too T O O next verse when they heard the king they departed and behold the star which they had seen in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with extremely great joy and when they had come into the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down say fell down or bow down and worship him and when they had opened their treasures say treasures they presented gifts to him gold frankincense and murder next verse then being divinely warmed in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed for their own country another way okay you may be seated I'm going to rush today but I'm going to cover the material in Jesus name hallelujah so we're considering today fake worshipers versus real worshipers you know for me one of the things that I'm upset about right now is that I can't always be sure what I'm seeing on the internet is real or not now I approach everything as fake until I convince myself it's true that's not a good thing hallelujah and when it comes to worship we need to be able to identify this is real worship this is fake we should not be confused about that hallelujah the story just read of Jesus's birth in the circumstances it's not just a Christmas story it gives us a way to test our hearts and to test our worship all the folks in this story built around Jesus participated or communicated the same message the wise men hurt the same message the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the religious leaders hurt the same message Herod hurt the same message it was the same message about the same king the same revelation but two different types of responses and both were called quote unquote worship one response was joyful and led to surrender led to give giving led to transformation the other response was one of fear to the message about the king and led to resistance to pretence and destruction those are the two different types of responses of course the response of the wise men as they as we call them is the positive model that has been said before us that real worshipers ought to pay attention to and hopefully replicate practice as their response to the message of Jesus so let's begin with these these real worshipers and look at them as a model I'm going to begin to be moving very quickly here but their worship began with hunger a hunger for knowing meeting discovering the king Jesus they asked the question where is he who has been born king nobody told them to ask those words they were not simply being religious they were genuinely hungry for the revelation of the king they wanted to meet him they wanted to know him they wanted to experience him for themselves and so they were asking people who should have known in this case it was a religious leader said people in Jerusalem who should have known they were asking them where is he this is a revelation of a true hunger for the knowledge of God and a true hunger for Jesus Christ they were not casual seekers they were serious seekers who are hungry for the truth Jesus said I'm the way I'm the truth and I'm the life and if we are going to be true worshipers then our desire for worship should be motivated by this real hunger we have to know Christ not just to know about him not just to hear about him not just to know he lived and he was born and he was born in Bethlehem if we're truly worshipping our desire is to meet him personally and to know him personally and for this reason these wise men left Persia and made a very long journey to come to Jerusalem because they were hungry for Jesus is your heart hungry for an encounter with Christ is your heart hungry to know him personally to experiencing him personally or are you simply satisfied with with second hand information amen here's the wonderful truth God has revealed Christ and God takes pleasure in making him known to us in the story God made him known sent a message in the heavens and through the stars they were able to come to know that Jesus was born the Bible tells us God does not leave himself with all our witness thank God that even in creation you can discover that God is you can learn so much about the character of God and nature of God the power of God a person of God just by observing creation say hallelujah and so just from creation there was a hunger in their hearts to truly know the truth concerning the one who created it all then secondly from these wise men we learned that the hunger for him gives rise to the pursuit of him you know you're hungry from the Lord for the Lord when you don't just sit and wait for revelation when you respond to every little bit of revelation by pursuing eating more you know I pray that I never get satisfied with the bit of information or revelation I have for Jesus I pray that every bit of information or revelation God gives me sparks in me and eating greater desire for more that causes me to be even more serious in my pursuit of him hallelujah may you and I never become complacent me we never get to the point that we said well I've seen him I've seen his star I know some things about him and because I do I'm satisfied all because I know now that I'm saved and I'm going to heaven that's enough for me and and what I'm going to do is just to make sure that I go to heaven and that's it no no no no you see when the truth is when you really see him every time you see you want to see him again amen and you want to see him more and you want to know him better that's why the angels that were surrounding the thrown in Isaiah chapter 6 kept saying holy and holy and holy because every time they saw him they realized of us more to see say hallelujah say Lord fill me with an insatiable hunger for you that causes me to pursue you constantly and always hallelujah their pursuit of him began when they saw his star in the heavens say they saw his star in the heavens and that star that they saw was the star that they gazed upon was a star that they focused on and it was a star that eventually brought them to him that's an important point I want to make about these types of worshipers there were many stars in the heavens you know too numerous to count but somehow they were able to ignore all those other stars and when they identified his star that was the only star they cared to focus on oh you didn't hear me there are many stars there are many things that you can look at there many things that you can focus on there are many things that you can gaze there are many things in this world in this light that you can pursue and allow it to absorb your attention absorb your life and become the focus of everything you do this ambition this goal this dream this person this man this woman there's amount of money this status in society this and you can focus on all of those other things and let those things be the the thing that drives you and you can never be happy you can never be satisfied you can never be fulfilled unless this thing happens oh my goodness may our eyes become so focused on Jesus that none of the other things that tried to seek our attention to grab our attention has any power over us because we're so consumed by him that really we don't care much about other things where is your focus is he real worship us focus on him and on those things that lead them closer and closer to him they ignore everything else the right of Hebrew says it this way forget those things which are behind and man says says let us let us who are running this race run this race with our eyes fix on Jesus worship us real worship us fix your eyes on Jesus and the wonderful thing is when you fix your eyes on Jesus it brings peace when you fix your eyes on Jesus it brings hope when you fix your eyes on Jesus it brings power hallelujah when you fix your eyes upon Jesus it brings true fulfillment thank God for Jesus come and raise your hand and say thank God for Jesus and let me ask you this question what star are you following they pursue Jesus and and and that man they travel far they followed long they kept going even when it was inconvenient and they followed him at great cost it costs a lot of time it costs a lot of money it costs a lot of effort to go from Persia to get to where Jesus was but nothing was too much no price was too great for them to pay in pursuit of him don't set any limits on what you would do how far you would go how much you would give in pursuit of him in fact you wouldn't get necessary to give your very lives for him there's a price that true worshipers are willing to pay in order to truly seek him and know him they're prepared to reorder their lives around the revelation of the king you see if they had not seen the star they would not have done anything that are recorded and other things recorded they would not have done that but they did all of these things they reorder their life because of the message that Christ was born you see people who don't know Jesus have an excuse for living the way they do the priorities they make they don't know him but we who know him we who are seeing him we who know and believe that he is the king listen to me the revelation of who he is if it is a revelation that you have received will cause you to reorder your priorities there's one set of priorities you have before you meet Christ but when you met him your priorities must be reorder to reflect that has what he is the one you live for he is the one you worship he is the one you seek after his will is what you want done in your life in Jesus name they brought their gifts and they worship him with treasures they didn't come to him empty handed that was a reflection of the reality of their heart they honored him with their substance Jesus said where your treasure is that's where your heart is going to be you know this week we traditionally use December to bring what we call gifts for the king because if we're celebrating the birth of Jesus then the one who should be receiving the gifts is he but the gifts of the king are not just for December amen our whole life is to be a gift to Jesus because he gave his whole life for us Jesus and just take of himself and gave us a portion he gave himself completely and totally for us and anyone who would do that deserves a response from us which is no less than offering ourselves completely to him I be seated you brethren by the mercy of God that you present your bodies in living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service of worship is reasonable that if he has given his life for us and we have discovered who he is and that he is the king is reasonable for us to respond by presenting and surrendering ourselves to him and that is the heart of true worship surrender anything short of surrender comes short of worship real worship the defining mark of worship is that act of surrender when they found him they bow down they surrender self they gave their substance their goal their frankincense their murder they place that all at his feet as if to save they no longer belong to us they are yours you are king we're not you are Lord we're not you're the star we're not and so we bow we surrender our self we resent surrender our substance to you all great king to do with them only as you wish for we're not Lord you are they Christ bring you and me to that place of surrender well we trust him enough if we have not yet done so to truly lay everything down at his feet and say Lord they're not mine they're yours do with me and do with this as you will now a lot of us are afraid to surrender but let me encourage you he is a great king indeed and deserves your surrender but he's also a humble king he rules his kingdom with grace and with mercy and you can be assured that he will not lord it over you and he will not use your surrender to take advantage of you you see he is a servant king and he taught us by example what his kingship looks like and how he responds to those who trust him enough to surrender themselves love him enough to offer himself totally to him he says a settlement did not come to be served but to serve for God so love the world he gave you don't need to be afraid of total surrender because the one day you're surrendering to loves you more than you love yourself did you hear me he actually loves you more than he loves then you love then you love yourself and so you can you can surrender to him because he is trustworthy raise your hand and say thank you Jesus I can surrender myself my substance my all to you for not only are you a great king you are the servant king oh I got to move I got to move amen so that if Jesus has revealed himself to you as he revealed himself to these wise men as the king then the response is not debate the response is not delay the response should be one of surrender bow down before him in Jesus name but then there's Herod oh I think I will have to continue this next week there is Herod who is the fake worshipper you know I call him false worshipper but since fake is in now he is the fake worshipper hallelujah quickly let's look at some things about Herod that makes him fake the Baba says concerning Herod when he heard the news concerning Jesus he was troubled troubled not joyful not excited not glad but troubled what would cause a man to become troubled by a message that Jesus Christ is born what would cause a man to be troubled by the message concerning Jesus the truth is it wasn't that he was troubled by Jesus what troubled him was that Jesus was a king you didn't hear me you see fake worshippers have a real problem with Jesus's kingship with Jesus's lordship hallelujah they love to hear that Jesus is savior they love to hear that Jesus is healer they love to hear that Jesus is the forgiver of all our sins say they love to hear that Jesus will bless and help they love that aspect but when you begin to deliver a message and you begin to draw their attention to the fact that Jesus is not just healer and savior and lover and forgiver but the same Jesus is king it troubles the fake worshipper because they know what it means they know that kingship of Jesus demands surrender of themselves it means they have to abdicate the throne of their lives on which they have been sitting all their lives it means they can no longer sit on the throne Jesus was now sit on the throne that troubles them they know they know now if Jesus is king they can no longer be the decider in chief that troubles them they know that now they have to listen to him and they can no longer be the owner one they listen to they understand if he's king somethings must stop and other things must begin and some of the things that must stop are things that they enjoy and then some things that must begin are things that they don't particularly care for like loving their neighbors like for giving their enemies and a lot of things that they had enable or convince themselves that it was okay they could be a Christian that's okay they could do this and that's okay and it didn't have to do that and it was to be okay but when you begin to talk about the Lord of the Jesus Christ and that he's king it means now that they must step aside and surrender control that they must now accept the reality that now they are accountable to him and must be accountable to him must be accountable to his word and even accountable to a body of people call the church that they belong to you see a lot of people struggle with the issue of control we want to serve him to a degree but we can't advocate our rights to make our decisions to reserve some things for ourselves here it was trouble because if Jesus was king and man he would no longer be king if Jesus was king he would have to step away from his throne surrender to the control to someone else now you know herds action was to try to kill the child and none of us would dare do that but let's be honest in many ways some of us here today and many of us watching being fact be like herod because we love the part of the gospel that talks about Jesus a savior healer forgive her but many of us still are holding on to some areas of control which will refuse a surrender to the king yes Lord I do this I do this but what about this and we don't want to surrender that part so let me ask you what part of your life may you be responding to in the way herod respond instead of joyfully surrendering the Christ you are actually resisting in that area because you want to be the decider in chief concerning that area again might be your time it might be your treasure might be your gifts it might be your finances just might be your marriage it just might be relationships you there's just certain eras and maybe this part I'm not willing yet to surrender into him because I know what his will is and that's not my will that's characteristic of thick thick worshipers may God give you me the grace to abdicate the throne and apply his lordship to every single area don't hold on don't you're not the decider in chief not in any area for life Christ is so fake worshipers that's one of one of the indicators is that we don't we're troubled by lordship kingship of Jesus here's another indicator here he inquires say he inquired he wanted information he wanted knowledge but he never intended for that information to transform him actually he was looking for information that would empower him to continue to do what he wanted to do and and hear me the desire for information but not the desire or the willingness for that information to transform you it's a clear indication of fake worshiping when and we worship him in spirit and in truth when we're real worship us like the wise men are we bow we surrender and in bowing and surrendering we're inviting him to carve his way with us which means any information we receive or desire is used to produce change and transformation in our lives if you want to remain the same and you simply want information you are not a real worshiper hey hear me you are not a real worshiper because true worship requires a willingness for the information that we are receiving to produce transformation in our lives so if you come to church like men that you do on a weekly basis and you get information but when that information requires transformation you're not willing to allow that transformation to take place because you want to be the same you love where you are you love what you're doing you want to hold on to being that and you really don't care about changing more and more into the image of the Christ that you have received information up that is not real worship guys hallelujah so may God again help me help you not just to get information that the information concerning Jesus produced transformation I told you a few weeks ago about the importance of meditation one of the reasons you meditate is because when you meditate on the information it can produce transformation in your life but when information just come here guessing your head listen getting your heart you're not changing and some of us are content with not changing because we're kind of like the way we are we will not want to change until we suffer until it causes us real pain before we will be willing to change don't wait until you experience pain before he said lord I'm willing to change once you see him and you realize you're not liking me that area let the information that you receive produced transformation in your life that's truly worshipping God say hallelujah amen so hear me don't desire salvation without submission don't be one of those who say I want to receive forgiveness but I don't want to be an authority I want heaven but I don't want obedience I want grace but I don't want lordship here's another thing about these about Herod again revealing fake worship what they Herod do when he heard that a child had been born the Pope says he sent the wise men to go find him in Bethlehem and then come and tell him and then he said I will go and worship him too so you all go do the hard work you spend the time you invest the energy you make the effort you do all of that to seek him and then when you have sought him come tell me and then I will go ahead and have a worship in other words they don't want to experience the hard parts of worship they only worship when they are able to do so without much effort without much time make it quick make it sweet let's do it let's enjoy so for them worship is just enjoying come on let's sing let's enjoy ourselves but when it's time to seek him when it's time to set aside time to pray to read to fast to wait upon the Lord the guys are things that the flesh does not like they delegate it to other people you go here God and then come tell me what God said you go and God the God and let me know what I should do in other words fake worshipers want it easy they're participating worship as long as it's easy on the flesh but when it requires a price when the flesh must pay a price they don't particularly care about that's an offer you don't find them let the preacher study the word then when he comes and preaches I will get it but don't expect me not to go and review it myself no no I'm not going to spend time reviewing it so that it gets from my head to my heart that's too much time that's too much effort so I'll go I'll sit for in fact if he goes by one hour it's too long so Bishop give it to me quick make it quick and short just give me the the mean points but you understand the point I'm making yeah yeah real worship us will spend the time we'll pay the price to get into the word to spend time with God to study and to take God's word and suck it in now you go and you do the work I show up for one hour on Sunday say the president I said your bishop is not talking to you and you are watching by by the internet I'm not talking to you either because I know you know better right hey man we know you don't delegate worship to somebody else worship is something you got to do and and sometimes it's sweet other times it's all the flesh does not like worship so you got to sometimes press on long enough to overcome the flesh before you can get to the place where worship is sweet but many of us never get there because we never are willing to show we delegate that part to other people and hope we can reap the benefits of the effort they make amen oh okay okay okay I got a jump I got a jump but I got to say this he says and I will come and worship also or I will come and worship too in other words and this is so true of fake worshipers many fake worshipers only quote-unquote worship because other people I don't it you know they're part of the crowd and as long as the crowd is doing it you will see them but they're just in the crowd the only reason is that's because you there that because your friends are there they they're friends stop coming you won't see them they don't have a personal relationship they don't have personal convictions they're not motivated from within they're just motivated by what's happening right now what's popular right now you you've seen it before you got folks who have charged one friend leaves and the other one these two one friend stops serving the Lord the rest of them stop serving the Lord because it's more about being in the crowd it's not about having a real personal relationship with Christ having your own personal convictions it's about just going with the crowd but that's not your portion in Jesus name and this is where I'm going to end today he says go tell me where so I will come in worship too and you know that he had no intention no intention of worshiping amen so at this point he is simply pretending I mean he is pretending he is pretending he has his own agenda and he's pretending to be a worshiper and a lot of people who are actually worshipping quote-unquote in our churches but they're really only pretending to worship Jesus they're actually worshipping something else they may be worshipping fame they may be worshipping popularity they may be worshipping power they may be worshipping possessions and most of all they may be worshipping themselves but they're pretending to be worshipping Jesus Jesus these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me Jesus said if you say you love me keep my commandments you know and he says therefore if you're not keeping his commandments you're only pretending to worship him with songs with music with dance but that's just those are just words there's no substance to it so let's stop the pretence amen if we're worshipping Jesus let's worship him for real and worshiping him for real means that we are worshipping him from our hearts means that we are going to be worshipping him with our works it means that we're not just going to love him with words but we're going to love him through our obedience and his commandment is that we love one another if we're truly worshipping him we're going to be loving one another Jesus said how can you say you love God whom you've never seen and you don't love your neighbor who you have seen so if we're not loving one another and yet we're claiming to be worshipping God we're pretending James said show me your fatal artworks I'll show you my faith by my works you see true worship will be demonstrated in our works of obedience so here is the end of the matter worship without surrendering is simply an attempt to manage God worship without surrender is not worship at all we sing we pray we attend but we still keep control we're still on the throne we want God but we don't want him close enough to confront us we want God but we don't want him close enough to change us we want him only close enough to bless us that's pretending to worship hallelujah we want to know him but we don't want to bow to him when when when worship is really management even though we use the word worship we really mean God I want to manage you we say God bless my plans but don't change them God heal me but please don't touch this part God speak to me but please don't speak to me about this what we call worship is actually an attempt to manage God and when we worship don't forget this when we worship with us surrendering we have made God a consultant not the king when I say I'm worshiping but I am refusing to surrender control I have reduced God from being the king that he is to a consultant I will consult you on matters that I think I need your advice on the other matters I will take care of them in a way I have deemed correct now we still hear say the person next to you here's the truth you must face you cannot worship the person you're trying to manage you can either bow and surrender to God or you can try to negotiate with him but he has the truth God does not negotiate his kingship so here's the invitation three things one stop trying to manage God that's fake worship step off the throne that's real worship lay down control that's real worship here are the three parts of my invitation one let's stop trying to manage God two let's step off the throne he is king three let's lay down control at his feet and trust him because at the end of the day worship is not measured but how loudly we sing worship is measured but how deeply we surrender let's stand to our feet raise your hands and those of you who are watching you can stand where you are too and I want you to raise your hand to the king because unto us is born this day a son a king and his name is Jesus and like the wise men we recognize what his kingship means and we realize that real worship requires that we now surrender not just with our words but to the surrender of ourselves our substance our plan our wills our ambitions we surrender them to him we let go of the rights to be the decider in chief as far we say his king we're not and so we allow him to be the decider in chief in our lives over every aspect of our lives our relationships he's decided in chief our finances he's decided in chief our career he's the decider in chief our time he's the decider in truth in chief he is and lord today we acknowledge that with our words but by the grace that you're giving us right now to obey you we choose to acknowledge this in our hearts and we claim the grace to walk in this revelation at every point with every decision would ever choice we make we will remember that you are the king of kings you have your way let your will be done let your purpose be done yes Jesus it is so in Jesus name amen amen god bless you you may have your seats and if you are watching online if you're here if you have not accepted Christ as your savior and as your lord I pray that you will do it today it's simple it's a matter of decision in your heart and then you release that decision with your mouth you say to Jesus Jesus I accept you I take you as my savior and as my lord and I acknowledge you today as my king have your way with me in Jesus name a symbol surrender of your heart in faith and Jesus is both savior and lord brings you into the kingdom and allows you then to experience his gift of eternal life you do it where you are you do it right here and you can then begin this new life in which Christ Jesus will work in you both as lord and savior in Jesus name amen

**[Unknown - 00:05]** All right. Let's go to the Word. We're in what we call the Christmas season.

**[00:06 - 00:12]** And so I want us to look at Matthew chapter 2 1 through 12 because I wanted to speak to you

**[00:12 - 00:19]** out of that very familiar passage related to the birth of Jesus. And this passage has to do with

**[00:19 - 00:28]** the worship of what we call the wise men. And also the response of Herod to the news concerning

**[00:28 - 00:36]** Jesus. You know we we live in a at a time now when the word fake if a key has risen to a new

**[00:36 - 00:48]** level. Amen. Now it's you know fake news and fake signs and fake reporters and what else?

**[00:48 - 00:58]** Uh? Fake prophets and and on and on. So we use the word fake a lot right now. And a lot of things

**[00:59 - 01:05]** now is difficult to determine is it true or is it fake? There were a time when we accepted

**[01:05 - 01:10]** everything and if it wasn't true we would say it's false but now we say it's fake. So fake is the

**[01:10 - 01:18]** new false right? And so today you know I want to talk about the fake and the real because there's

**[01:18 - 01:25]** fake worship and there's real worship. And while all of these other fake this and fake that may or

**[01:25 - 01:35]** may not be important most certainly whether worship is real or fake is absolutely critical because

**[01:35 - 01:42]** at this point you're dealing with eternal things. Amen. And I believe the story recorded here

**[01:42 - 01:50]** of the wise men and Herod and their response to Jesus gives us an opening for us to begin to

**[01:50 - 01:58]** consider and get some insights into what is fake worship and what is real worship because we know

**[01:58 - 02:05]** the father is seeking people who will worship him in spirit and in truth. The father wants some real

**[02:05 - 02:13]** worshipers and we don't want to be among those who are fake. Hallelujah. So here is the big idea.

**[02:13 - 02:22]** The revelation of Jesus as king always demands a response and that response will determine whether

**[02:22 - 02:31]** we are fake or real in terms of our worship. So let's quickly read the story. Let's stand very quickly.

**[02:32 - 02:39]** I'm going to be referring to this story and so let's really get in our mind. So when I make

**[02:39 - 02:46]** reference you know you saw it in the passage together we'll read it out. Now after Jesus was born

**[02:46 - 02:55]** in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men from the east came to Jerusalem

**[02:58 - 03:06]** saying where is he who has been born king of the Jews but we have seen his star in the east and

**[03:06 - 03:16]** I've come to worship him when Herod the king heard this he was what troubled and all Jerusalem

**[03:16 - 03:23]** with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he

**[03:23 - 03:32]** inquired say inquired of them where the Christ was to be born next verse so they said to him in

**[03:32 - 03:40]** Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet amen say thus it is written but you

**[03:40 - 03:46]** Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the rulers of Judah for out of you

**[03:46 - 03:55]** shall come a ruler who was shepherd by people Israel say thank God for Jesus. Hallelujah then Herod

**[03:55 - 04:02]** when he had secretly called the wise men determined from them what time the star appeared

**[04:03 - 04:11]** and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search carefully for the young child and when you

**[04:11 - 04:19]** have found him bring back words to me that I become and worship him also I think the king James

**[04:19 - 04:26]** versions that worship him too T O O next verse when they heard the king they departed and behold the

**[04:26 - 04:33]** star which they had seen in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young

**[04:33 - 04:45]** child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with extremely great joy and when they had come

**[04:45 - 04:52]** into the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down say fell down or bow down

**[04:52 - 05:01]** and worship him and when they had opened their treasures say treasures they presented gifts to him

**[05:01 - 05:08]** gold frankincense and murder next verse then being divinely warmed in a dream that they should not

**[05:08 - 05:15]** return to Herod they departed for their own country another way okay you may be seated I'm going

**[05:15 - 05:24]** to rush today but I'm going to cover the material in Jesus name hallelujah so we're considering

**[05:24 - 05:35]** today fake worshipers versus real worshipers you know for me one of the things that I'm upset about

**[05:35 - 05:42]** right now is that I can't always be sure what I'm seeing on the internet is real or not now I

**[05:42 - 05:49]** approach everything as fake until I convince myself it's true that's not a good thing hallelujah

**[05:50 - 05:56]** and when it comes to worship we need to be able to identify this is real worship this is fake we

**[05:56 - 06:03]** should not be confused about that hallelujah the story just read of Jesus's birth in the circumstances

**[06:04 - 06:11]** it's not just a Christmas story it gives us a way to test our hearts and to test our worship

**[06:13 - 06:23]** all the folks in this story built around Jesus participated or communicated the same message

**[06:24 - 06:33]** the wise men hurt the same message the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the religious leaders

**[06:33 - 06:39]** hurt the same message Herod hurt the same message it was the same message about the same

**[06:39 - 06:50]** king the same revelation but two different types of responses and both were called

**[06:50 - 07:00]** quote unquote worship one response was joyful and led to surrender led to give giving led to

**[07:00 - 07:08]** transformation the other response was one of fear to the message about the king

**[07:08 - 07:16]** and led to resistance to pretence and destruction those are the two different types of responses

**[07:16 - 07:24]** of course the response of the wise men as they as we call them is the positive model that has been

**[07:24 - 07:34]** said before us that real worshipers ought to pay attention to and hopefully replicate practice

**[07:35 - 07:43]** as their response to the message of Jesus so let's begin with these these real worshipers and

**[07:43 - 07:50]** look at them as a model I'm going to begin to be moving very quickly here but their worship began

**[07:50 - 08:03]** with hunger a hunger for knowing meeting discovering the king Jesus they asked the question where

**[08:03 - 08:12]** is he who has been born king nobody told them to ask those words they were not simply being

**[08:12 - 08:20]** religious they were genuinely hungry for the revelation of the king they wanted to meet him they

**[08:20 - 08:26]** wanted to know him they wanted to experience him for themselves and so they were asking people

**[08:26 - 08:32]** who should have known in this case it was a religious leader said people in Jerusalem who should have

**[08:32 - 08:41]** known they were asking them where is he this is a revelation of a true hunger for the knowledge

**[08:41 - 08:50]** of God and a true hunger for Jesus Christ they were not casual seekers they were serious

**[08:50 - 08:57]** seekers who are hungry for the truth Jesus said I'm the way I'm the truth and I'm the life

**[08:58 - 09:10]** and if we are going to be true worshipers then our desire for worship should be motivated by this

**[09:11 - 09:20]** real hunger we have to know Christ not just to know about him not just to hear about him not

**[09:20 - 09:26]** just to know he lived and he was born and he was born in Bethlehem if we're truly worshipping

**[09:27 - 09:35]** our desire is to meet him personally and to know him personally and for this reason these

**[09:35 - 09:43]** wise men left Persia and made a very long journey to come to Jerusalem because they were hungry

**[09:44 - 09:52]** for Jesus is your heart hungry for an encounter with Christ is your heart hungry to know him personally

**[09:52 - 09:59]** to experiencing him personally or are you simply satisfied with with second hand

**[10:00 - 10:10]** information amen here's the wonderful truth God has revealed Christ and God takes pleasure in

**[10:10 - 10:19]** making him known to us in the story God made him known sent a message in the heavens

**[10:19 - 10:28]** and through the stars they were able to come to know that Jesus was born the Bible tells us God does

**[10:28 - 10:34]** not leave himself with all our witness thank God that even in creation you can discover

**[10:34 - 10:41]** that God is you can learn so much about the character of God and nature of God the power of God

**[10:41 - 10:52]** a person of God just by observing creation say hallelujah and so just from creation there was a hunger

**[10:52 - 11:00]** in their hearts to truly know the truth concerning the one who created it all then secondly

**[11:00 - 11:15]** from these wise men we learned that the hunger for him gives rise to the pursuit of him you know

**[11:15 - 11:23]** you're hungry from the Lord for the Lord when you don't just sit and wait for revelation when you

**[11:23 - 11:31]** respond to every little bit of revelation by pursuing eating more you know I pray that I never

**[11:31 - 11:38]** get satisfied with the bit of information or revelation I have for Jesus I pray that every bit

**[11:38 - 11:44]** of information or revelation God gives me sparks in me and eating greater desire for more that

**[11:44 - 11:52]** causes me to be even more serious in my pursuit of him hallelujah may you and I never become

**[11:52 - 12:00]** complacent me we never get to the point that we said well I've seen him I've seen his star I know

**[12:00 - 12:07]** some things about him and because I do I'm satisfied all because I know now that I'm saved and I'm

**[12:07 - 12:13]** going to heaven that's enough for me and and what I'm going to do is just to make sure that I go to

**[12:13 - 12:19]** heaven and that's it no no no no you see when the truth is when you really see him every time you see

**[12:20 - 12:27]** you want to see him again amen and you want to see him more and you want to know him better that's

**[12:27 - 12:34]** why the angels that were surrounding the thrown in Isaiah chapter 6 kept saying holy and holy and

**[12:34 - 12:41]** holy because every time they saw him they realized of us more to see say hallelujah say Lord

**[12:42 - 12:50]** fill me with an insatiable hunger for you that causes me to pursue you

**[12:51 - 13:03]** constantly and always hallelujah their pursuit of him began when they saw his star in the heavens

**[13:04 - 13:14]** say they saw his star in the heavens and that star that they saw was the star that they gazed upon

**[13:14 - 13:20]** was a star that they focused on and it was a star that eventually brought them to him

**[13:21 - 13:29]** that's an important point I want to make about these types of worshipers there were many stars in the

**[13:29 - 13:39]** heavens you know too numerous to count but somehow they were able to ignore all those other stars

**[13:41 - 13:48]** and when they identified his star that was the only star they cared to focus on

**[13:48 - 13:55]** oh you didn't hear me there are many stars there are many things that you can look at there

**[13:55 - 14:01]** many things that you can focus on there are many things that you can gaze there are many things in

**[14:01 - 14:07]** this world in this light that you can pursue and allow it to absorb your attention absorb your life

**[14:07 - 14:14]** and become the focus of everything you do this ambition this goal this dream this person this man this

**[14:14 - 14:21]** woman there's amount of money this status in society this and you can focus on all of those

**[14:21 - 14:29]** other things and let those things be the the thing that drives you and you can never be happy you

**[14:29 - 14:35]** can never be satisfied you can never be fulfilled unless this thing happens oh my goodness

**[14:36 - 14:46]** may our eyes become so focused on Jesus that none of the other things that tried to seek our

**[14:46 - 14:57]** attention to grab our attention has any power over us because we're so consumed by him that really we

**[14:57 - 15:11]** don't care much about other things where is your focus is he real worship us focus on him and on

**[15:11 - 15:27]** those things that lead them closer and closer to him they ignore everything else the right of

**[15:27 - 15:30]** Hebrew says it this way forget those things which are behind

**[15:31 - 15:41]** and man says says let us let us who are running this race run this race with our eyes fix

**[15:42 - 15:54]** on Jesus worship us real worship us fix your eyes on Jesus and the wonderful thing is when you fix

**[15:54 - 16:01]** your eyes on Jesus it brings peace when you fix your eyes on Jesus it brings hope when you fix

**[16:01 - 16:11]** your eyes on Jesus it brings power hallelujah when you fix your eyes upon Jesus it brings true

**[16:11 - 16:18]** fulfillment thank God for Jesus come and raise your hand and say thank God for Jesus

**[16:18 - 16:28]** and let me ask you this question what star are you following they pursue Jesus and and and that

**[16:28 - 16:37]** man they travel far they followed long they kept going even when it was inconvenient and they

**[16:37 - 16:46]** followed him at great cost it costs a lot of time it costs a lot of money it costs a lot of effort

**[16:46 - 16:53]** to go from Persia to get to where Jesus was but nothing was too much no price was too great

**[16:55 - 17:10]** for them to pay in pursuit of him don't set any limits on what you would do how far you would go

**[17:11 - 17:21]** how much you would give in pursuit of him in fact you wouldn't get necessary to give your very

**[17:21 - 17:33]** lives for him there's a price that true worshipers are willing to pay in order to truly seek him

**[17:33 - 17:46]** and know him they're prepared to reorder their lives around the revelation of the king you see if

**[17:46 - 17:52]** they had not seen the star they would not have done anything that are recorded and other things

**[17:52 - 17:58]** recorded they would not have done that but they did all of these things they reorder their life

**[17:59 - 18:08]** because of the message that Christ was born you see people who don't know Jesus have an excuse

**[18:09 - 18:14]** for living the way they do the priorities they make they don't know him but we who know him

**[18:15 - 18:24]** we who are seeing him we who know and believe that he is the king listen to me the revelation of who

**[18:24 - 18:31]** he is if it is a revelation that you have received will cause you to reorder your priorities

**[18:34 - 18:42]** there's one set of priorities you have before you meet Christ but when you met him your priorities

**[18:43 - 18:51]** must be reorder to reflect that has what he is the one you live for he is the one you worship

**[18:51 - 18:59]** he is the one you seek after his will is what you want done in your life in Jesus name

**[19:00 - 19:06]** they brought their gifts and they worship him with treasures they didn't come to him empty handed

**[19:06 - 19:13]** that was a reflection of the reality of their heart they honored him with their substance Jesus said

**[19:14 - 19:21]** where your treasure is that's where your heart is going to be you know this week we traditionally

**[19:21 - 19:27]** use December to bring what we call gifts for the king because if we're celebrating the birth

**[19:27 - 19:37]** of Jesus then the one who should be receiving the gifts is he but the gifts of the king are not just

**[19:37 - 19:51]** for December amen our whole life is to be a gift to Jesus because he gave his whole life for us

**[19:52 - 20:00]** Jesus and just take of himself and gave us a portion he gave himself completely and totally

**[20:00 - 20:09]** for us and anyone who would do that deserves a response from us which is no less than offering

**[20:09 - 20:16]** ourselves completely to him I be seated you brethren by the mercy of God that you present your

**[20:16 - 20:26]** bodies in living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service of worship

**[20:26 - 20:33]** is reasonable that if he has given his life for us and we have discovered who he is and that he

**[20:33 - 20:43]** is the king is reasonable for us to respond by presenting and surrendering ourselves to him and

**[20:43 - 20:54]** that is the heart of true worship surrender anything short of surrender comes short of worship

**[20:56 - 21:07]** real worship the defining mark of worship is that act of surrender when they found him they bow down

**[21:07 - 21:17]** they surrender self they gave their substance their goal their frankincense their murder they place

**[21:17 - 21:29]** that all at his feet as if to save they no longer belong to us they are yours you are king we're not

**[21:29 - 21:45]** you are Lord we're not you're the star we're not and so we bow we surrender our self we resent surrender

**[21:45 - 21:57]** our substance to you all great king to do with them only as you wish for we're not Lord you are

**[21:58 - 22:05]** they Christ bring you and me to that place of surrender well we trust him enough if we have not yet

**[22:05 - 22:14]** done so to truly lay everything down at his feet and say Lord they're not mine they're yours do with me

**[22:14 - 22:22]** and do with this as you will now a lot of us are afraid to surrender but let me encourage you

**[22:23 - 22:29]** he is a great king indeed and deserves your surrender but he's also a humble king

**[22:32 - 22:41]** he rules his kingdom with grace and with mercy and you can be assured that he will not lord it

**[22:41 - 22:49]** over you and he will not use your surrender to take advantage of you you see he is a servant king

**[22:50 - 22:57]** and he taught us by example what his kingship looks like and how he responds to those who trust

**[22:57 - 23:02]** him enough to surrender themselves love him enough to offer himself totally to him

**[23:03 - 23:10]** he says a settlement did not come to be served but to serve for God so love the world he gave

**[23:11 - 23:15]** you don't need to be afraid of total surrender because the one day you're surrendering to loves

**[23:15 - 23:22]** you more than you love yourself did you hear me he actually loves you more than he loves then you

**[23:22 - 23:30]** love then you love yourself and so you can you can surrender to him because he is trustworthy raise

**[23:30 - 23:39]** your hand and say thank you Jesus I can surrender myself my substance my all to you for not only

**[23:39 - 23:50]** are you a great king you are the servant king oh I got to move I got to move amen so that

**[23:51 - 23:58]** if Jesus has revealed himself to you as he revealed himself to these wise men as the king then

**[24:00 - 24:09]** the response is not debate the response is not delay the response should be one of surrender

**[24:10 - 24:19]** bow down before him in Jesus name but then there's Herod oh I think I will have to continue

**[24:19 - 24:29]** this next week there is Herod who is the fake worshipper you know I call him false worshipper but since

**[24:29 - 24:39]** fake is in now he is the fake worshipper hallelujah quickly let's look at some things about Herod

**[24:39 - 24:48]** that makes him fake the Baba says concerning Herod when he heard the news concerning Jesus he was

**[24:48 - 24:59]** troubled troubled not joyful not excited not glad but troubled what would cause a man

**[25:00 - 25:09]** to become troubled by a message that Jesus Christ is born what would cause a man to be troubled

**[25:10 - 25:18]** by the message concerning Jesus the truth is it wasn't that he was troubled by Jesus

**[25:19 - 25:30]** what troubled him was that Jesus was a king you didn't hear me you see fake worshippers have a real

**[25:30 - 25:39]** problem with Jesus's kingship with Jesus's lordship hallelujah they love to hear that Jesus is

**[25:39 - 25:49]** savior they love to hear that Jesus is healer they love to hear that Jesus is the

**[25:49 - 25:57]** forgiver of all our sins say they love to hear that Jesus will bless and help they love that

**[25:57 - 26:05]** aspect but when you begin to deliver a message and you begin to draw their attention to the fact

**[26:05 - 26:14]** that Jesus is not just healer and savior and lover and forgiver but the same Jesus is king

**[26:15 - 26:23]** it troubles the fake worshipper because they know what it means they know that kingship

**[26:24 - 26:37]** of Jesus demands surrender of themselves it means they have to abdicate the throne of their lives

**[26:37 - 26:46]** on which they have been sitting all their lives it means they can no longer sit on the throne

**[26:46 - 26:54]** Jesus was now sit on the throne that troubles them they know they know now if Jesus is king

**[26:54 - 27:01]** they can no longer be the decider in chief that troubles them they know that now they have to

**[27:01 - 27:07]** listen to him and they can no longer be the owner one they listen to they understand if he's

**[27:07 - 27:15]** king somethings must stop and other things must begin and some of the things that must stop are

**[27:15 - 27:20]** things that they enjoy and then some things that must begin are things that they don't particularly

**[27:21 - 27:28]** care for like loving their neighbors like for giving their enemies and a lot of things that they

**[27:28 - 27:35]** had enable or convince themselves that it was okay they could be a Christian that's okay they could

**[27:35 - 27:40]** do this and that's okay and it didn't have to do that and it was to be okay but when you begin

**[27:40 - 27:45]** to talk about the Lord of the Jesus Christ and that he's king it means now that they must

**[27:45 - 27:52]** step aside and surrender control that they must now accept the reality that now they are

**[27:52 - 27:58]** accountable to him and must be accountable to him must be accountable to his word and even

**[27:58 - 28:08]** accountable to a body of people call the church that they belong to you see a lot of people struggle

**[28:08 - 28:16]** with the issue of control we want to serve him to a degree but we can't

**[28:18 - 28:27]** advocate our rights to make our decisions to reserve some things for ourselves

**[28:28 - 28:34]** here it was trouble because if Jesus was king and man he would no longer be king if Jesus

**[28:34 - 28:41]** was king he would have to step away from his throne surrender to the control to someone else

**[28:42 - 28:50]** now you know herds action was to try to kill the child and none of us would dare do that but

**[28:50 - 28:57]** let's be honest in many ways some of us here today and many of us watching being fact be like

**[28:57 - 29:03]** herod because we love the part of the gospel that talks about Jesus a savior healer forgive her

**[29:04 - 29:13]** but many of us still are holding on to some areas of control which will refuse a surrender to the

**[29:13 - 29:23]** king yes Lord I do this I do this but what about this and we don't want to surrender that part

**[29:24 - 29:30]** so let me ask you what part of your life may you be responding to in the way herod respond

**[29:30 - 29:35]** instead of joyfully surrendering the Christ you are actually resisting in that area

**[29:36 - 29:44]** because you want to be the decider in chief concerning that area again might be your time it might

**[29:44 - 29:48]** be your treasure might be your gifts it might be your finances just might be your marriage it

**[29:48 - 29:55]** just might be relationships you there's just certain eras and maybe this part I'm not willing

**[29:56 - 30:11]** yet to surrender into him because I know what his will is and that's not my will that's characteristic

**[30:11 - 30:22]** of thick thick worshipers may God give you me the grace to abdicate the throne and apply his

**[30:22 - 30:31]** lordship to every single area don't hold on don't you're not the decider in chief not in

**[30:32 - 30:40]** any area for life Christ is so fake worshipers that's one of one of the indicators

**[30:42 - 30:46]** is that we don't we're troubled by lordship kingship of Jesus

**[30:47 - 30:58]** here's another indicator here he inquires say he inquired he wanted information

**[30:59 - 31:05]** he wanted knowledge but he never intended for that information to transform him

**[31:06 - 31:10]** actually he was looking for information that would empower him to continue

**[31:11 - 31:20]** to do what he wanted to do and and hear me the desire for information

**[31:21 - 31:28]** but not the desire or the willingness for that information to transform you it's a clear indication

**[31:28 - 31:37]** of fake worshiping when and we worship him in spirit and in truth when we're real worship us

**[31:37 - 31:46]** like the wise men are we bow we surrender and in bowing and surrendering we're inviting him

**[31:46 - 31:55]** to carve his way with us which means any information we receive or desire is used to produce change

**[31:55 - 32:01]** and transformation in our lives if you want to remain the same and you simply want information

**[32:01 - 32:11]** you are not a real worshiper hey hear me you are not a real worshiper because true worship

**[32:11 - 32:18]** requires a willingness for the information that we are receiving to produce transformation in

**[32:18 - 32:25]** our lives so if you come to church like men that you do on a weekly basis and you get information

**[32:25 - 32:31]** but when that information requires transformation you're not willing to allow that transformation

**[32:31 - 32:36]** to take place because you want to be the same you love where you are you love what you're doing

**[32:36 - 32:44]** you want to hold on to being that and you really don't care about changing more and more into the

**[32:44 - 32:53]** image of the Christ that you have received information up that is not real worship guys hallelujah

**[32:54 - 33:00]** so may God again help me help you not just to get information that the information concerning

**[33:00 - 33:07]** Jesus produced transformation I told you a few weeks ago about the importance of meditation

**[33:07 - 33:12]** one of the reasons you meditate is because when you meditate on the information it can produce

**[33:12 - 33:16]** transformation in your life but when information just come here guessing your head listen

**[33:16 - 33:20]** getting your heart you're not changing and some of us are content with not changing because we're

**[33:20 - 33:25]** kind of like the way we are we will not want to change until we suffer until it causes us real pain

**[33:25 - 33:31]** before we will be willing to change don't wait until you experience pain before he said lord I'm

**[33:31 - 33:38]** willing to change once you see him and you realize you're not liking me that area let the information

**[33:38 - 33:45]** that you receive produced transformation in your life that's truly worshipping God say hallelujah

**[33:46 - 33:52]** amen so hear me don't desire salvation without submission don't be one of those who say I want to

**[33:52 - 33:57]** receive forgiveness but I don't want to be an authority I want heaven but I don't want obedience I

**[33:57 - 34:07]** want grace but I don't want lordship here's another thing about these about Herod again revealing

**[34:07 - 34:14]** fake worship what they Herod do when he heard that a child had been born the Pope says he sent the

**[34:14 - 34:22]** wise men to go find him in Bethlehem and then come and tell him and then he said I will go and

**[34:22 - 34:32]** worship him too so you all go do the hard work you spend the time you invest the energy you make

**[34:32 - 34:39]** the effort you do all of that to seek him and then when you have sought him come tell me and then I

**[34:39 - 34:46]** will go ahead and have a worship in other words they don't want to experience the hard parts

**[34:46 - 34:59]** of worship they only worship when they are able to do so without much effort

**[35:01 - 35:08]** without much time make it quick make it sweet let's do it let's enjoy so for them worship is just

**[35:08 - 35:20]** enjoying come on let's sing let's enjoy ourselves but when it's time to seek him when it's time

**[35:20 - 35:31]** to set aside time to pray to read to fast to wait upon the Lord the guys are things that the flesh

**[35:31 - 35:40]** does not like they delegate it to other people you go here God and then come tell me what God said

**[35:40 - 35:50]** you go and God the God and let me know what I should do in other words fake worshipers want it easy

**[35:50 - 36:03]** they're participating worship as long as it's easy on the flesh but when it requires a price

**[36:03 - 36:12]** when the flesh must pay a price they don't particularly care about that's an offer you don't

**[36:12 - 36:20]** find them let the preacher study the word then when he comes and preaches I will get it but don't

**[36:20 - 36:27]** expect me not to go and review it myself no no I'm not going to spend time reviewing it so that it

**[36:27 - 36:33]** gets from my head to my heart that's too much time that's too much effort so I'll go I'll sit for in

**[36:33 - 36:37]** fact if he goes by one hour it's too long so Bishop give it to me quick make it quick and short

**[36:39 - 36:48]** just give me the the mean points but you understand the point I'm making yeah yeah real worship us

**[36:48 - 36:56]** will spend the time we'll pay the price to get into the word to spend time with God to study

**[36:56 - 37:06]** and to take God's word and suck it in now you go and you do the work I show up

**[37:07 - 37:15]** for one hour on Sunday say the president I said your bishop is not talking to you

**[37:17 - 37:21]** and you are watching by by the internet I'm not talking to you either

**[37:23 - 37:29]** because I know you know better right hey man we know you don't delegate worship to somebody else

**[37:29 - 37:34]** worship is something you got to do and and sometimes it's sweet

**[37:34 - 37:45]** other times it's all the flesh does not like worship so you got to sometimes press on long enough

**[37:45 - 37:52]** to overcome the flesh before you can get to the place where worship is sweet but many of us never

**[37:52 - 37:57]** get there because we never are willing to show we delegate that part to other people and hope we

**[37:57 - 38:07]** can reap the benefits of the effort they make amen oh okay okay okay I got a jump I got a jump

**[38:09 - 38:17]** but I got to say this he says and I will come and worship also or I will come and worship too

**[38:18 - 38:23]** in other words and this is so true of fake worshipers many fake worshipers only quote-unquote

**[38:23 - 38:33]** worship because other people I don't it you know they're part of the crowd and as long as the crowd

**[38:33 - 38:40]** is doing it you will see them but they're just in the crowd the only reason is that's because you

**[38:40 - 38:51]** there that because your friends are there they they're friends stop coming you won't see them

**[38:51 - 38:57]** they don't have a personal relationship they don't have personal convictions they're not

**[38:57 - 39:02]** motivated from within they're just motivated by what's happening right now what's popular right now

**[39:04 - 39:09]** you you've seen it before you got folks who have charged one friend leaves and the other one these two

**[39:12 - 39:17]** one friend stops serving the Lord the rest of them stop serving the Lord because it's more about

**[39:17 - 39:23]** being in the crowd it's not about having a real personal relationship with Christ having

**[39:23 - 39:30]** your own personal convictions it's about just going with the crowd but that's not your portion

**[39:31 - 39:41]** in Jesus name and this is where I'm going to end today he says go tell me where so I will come

**[39:41 - 39:52]** in worship too and you know that he had no intention no intention of worshiping amen so at

**[39:52 - 40:04]** this point he is simply pretending I mean he is pretending he is pretending he has his own agenda

**[40:04 - 40:12]** and he's pretending to be a worshiper and a lot of people who are actually worshipping

**[40:13 - 40:20]** quote-unquote in our churches but they're really only pretending to worship Jesus they're actually

**[40:20 - 40:26]** worshipping something else they may be worshipping fame they may be worshipping popularity they may

**[40:26 - 40:31]** be worshipping power they may be worshipping possessions and most of all they may be worshipping

**[40:32 - 40:44]** themselves but they're pretending to be worshipping Jesus Jesus these people honor me with their lips

**[40:45 - 40:53]** but their hearts are far from me Jesus said if you say you love me keep my commandments you know

**[40:53 - 40:58]** and he says therefore if you're not keeping his commandments you're only pretending to worship him

**[40:59 - 41:06]** with songs with music with dance but that's just those are just words there's no substance to it

**[41:09 - 41:19]** so let's stop the pretence amen if we're worshipping Jesus let's worship him for real and worshiping

**[41:19 - 41:26]** him for real means that we are worshipping him from our hearts means that we are going to be

**[41:26 - 41:31]** worshipping him with our works it means that we're not just going to love him with words

**[41:32 - 41:39]** but we're going to love him through our obedience and his commandment is that we love one another if

**[41:39 - 41:45]** we're truly worshipping him we're going to be loving one another Jesus said how can you say you love

**[41:45 - 41:52]** God whom you've never seen and you don't love your neighbor who you have seen so if we're not

**[41:52 - 41:58]** loving one another and yet we're claiming to be worshipping God we're pretending

**[41:58 - 42:07]** James said show me your fatal artworks I'll show you my faith by my works you see true worship

**[42:07 - 42:18]** will be demonstrated in our works of obedience so here is the end of the matter worship without

**[42:18 - 42:34]** surrendering is simply an attempt to manage God worship without surrender is not worship at all

**[42:38 - 42:50]** we sing we pray we attend but we still keep control we're still on the throne

**[42:51 - 42:54]** we want God but we don't want him

**[42:58 - 43:05]** close enough to confront us we want God but we don't want him close enough to change us

**[43:07 - 43:15]** we want him only close enough to bless us that's pretending to worship hallelujah

**[43:16 - 43:24]** we want to know him but we don't want to bow to him when when when worship is really

**[43:24 - 43:31]** management even though we use the word worship we really mean God I want to manage you we say God

**[43:31 - 43:38]** bless my plans but don't change them God heal me but please don't touch this part

**[43:40 - 43:49]** God speak to me but please don't speak to me about this what we call worship is actually an attempt

**[43:50 - 43:58]** to manage God and when we worship don't forget this when we worship with us surrendering

**[43:59 - 44:13]** we have made God a consultant not the king when I say I'm worshiping but I am refusing

**[44:13 - 44:21]** to surrender control I have reduced God from being the king that he is to a consultant I will

**[44:21 - 44:30]** consult you on matters that I think I need your advice on the other matters I will take care of

**[44:30 - 44:46]** them in a way I have deemed correct now we still hear say the person next to you here's the truth

**[44:46 - 45:01]** you must face you cannot worship the person you're trying to manage you can either bow and surrender

**[45:01 - 45:06]** to God or you can try to negotiate with him but he has the truth God does not negotiate his

**[45:06 - 45:24]** kingship so here's the invitation three things one stop trying to manage God that's fake worship step

**[45:24 - 45:37]** off the throne that's real worship lay down control that's real worship here are the three parts of

**[45:37 - 45:46]** my invitation one let's stop trying to manage God two let's step off the throne he is king three

**[45:46 - 45:54]** let's lay down control at his feet and trust him because at the end of the day worship is not measured

**[45:54 - 46:06]** but how loudly we sing worship is measured but how deeply we surrender let's stand to our feet

**[46:13 - 46:18]** raise your hands and those of you who are watching you can stand where you are too

**[46:20 - 46:31]** and I want you to raise your hand to the king because unto us is born this day a son a king

**[46:32 - 46:41]** and his name is Jesus and like the wise men we recognize what his kingship means

**[46:42 - 46:49]** and we realize that real worship requires that we now surrender not just with our words

**[46:50 - 46:58]** but to the surrender of ourselves our substance our plan our wills our ambitions we surrender them to

**[46:58 - 47:07]** him we let go of the rights to be the decider in chief as far we say his king we're not

**[47:07 - 47:15]** and so we allow him to be the decider in chief in our lives over every aspect of our lives

**[47:18 - 47:26]** our relationships he's decided in chief our finances he's decided in chief our career he's the

**[47:26 - 47:39]** decider in chief our time he's the decider in truth in chief he is and lord today we acknowledge that

**[47:39 - 47:47]** with our words but by the grace that you're giving us right now to obey you we choose to acknowledge this

**[47:48 - 47:57]** in our hearts and we claim the grace to walk in this revelation at every point with every decision

**[47:57 - 48:11]** would ever choice we make we will remember that you are the king of kings you have your way

**[48:12 - 48:25]** let your will be done let your purpose be done yes Jesus it is so in Jesus name amen amen god bless

**[48:25 - 48:33]** you you may have your seats and if you are watching online if you're here if you have not accepted

**[48:33 - 48:41]** Christ as your savior and as your lord I pray that you will do it today it's simple it's a matter of

**[48:41 - 48:49]** decision in your heart and then you release that decision with your mouth you say to Jesus Jesus I

**[48:49 - 48:57]** accept you I take you as my savior and as my lord and I acknowledge you today as my king

**[48:57 - 49:05]** have your way with me in Jesus name a symbol surrender of your heart in faith and Jesus is both

**[49:05 - 49:12]** savior and lord brings you into the kingdom and allows you then to experience his gift of eternal

**[49:12 - 49:20]** life you do it where you are you do it right here and you can then begin this new life in which Christ

**[49:20 - 49:27]** Jesus will work in you both as lord and savior in Jesus name amen

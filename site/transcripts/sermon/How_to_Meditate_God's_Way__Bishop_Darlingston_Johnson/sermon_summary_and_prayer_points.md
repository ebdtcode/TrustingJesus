## SERMON SUMMARY

Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivers a transformative teaching on biblical meditation, building upon Joshua 1:8 as the foundational text. The central message is clear: meditation on God's Word is not optional but essential for fulfilling God's divine assignment and experiencing true prosperity and success in life.

The sermon begins by distinguishing biblical meditation from mere reading. While reading provides information, meditation produces transformation. God instructed Joshua that the key to successfully leading Israel into the Promised Land was not mastering warfare tactics, but meditating on God's Word day and night. This wasn't about material prosperity, but about fulfilling God's heavenly assignment with good success.

The Bishop explains that biblical meditation is a spirit-led practice of focusing your mind on God, His Word, and His truth in a sustained manner until it transforms the way you think, believe, and behave. The ultimate goal of meditation is to exchange your thoughts for God's thoughts. Using Proverbs 23:7 - "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he" - he emphasizes that thoughts are extremely powerful and determine our emotions, behaviors, and ultimately our life results.

A compelling illustration demonstrates how the brain can be wired and rewired through repeated focus. Bishop Johnson shares the story of a woman who experienced sadness every Monday through Thursday due to childhood abandonment feelings when her father was away, even though as an adult the circumstances had changed. Her brain had been wired to connect those days with abandonment. The good news: through meditation on God's Word, our brains can be rewired. This is what Romans 12 calls "renewing your mind."

The sermon addresses contemporary issues, explaining how pornography has rewired many people's natural attractions through sustained negative meditation. However, if meditating on darkness can change someone fundamentally, then meditating on the light of God's Word has even more power to transform desires toward godliness.

Bishop Johnson emphasizes that meditation should be prioritized even above prayer and worship, not because those are unimportant, but because meditation actually sets prayer and worship on fire. Worshiping without revelation becomes empty words, but meditating on God's goodness before worship ignites it with power.

The practical framework presented uses two memorable acronyms:

**The 4 M's:**
1. **Muse silently** - Turn the truth over in your mind, pondering it
2. **Mutter softly** - Whisper the words under your breath repeatedly
3. **Mouth it strongly** - Speak it aloud with confidence
4. **Memorize it** - Store it in your heart to recall throughout the day

**The MEDITATE Acrostic:**
- **M** - Make time for meditation (schedule it, don't hope it happens)
- **E** - Embrace silence and stillness (eliminate distractions, especially phones)
- **D** - Determine your focus (choose your verse or truth)
- **I** - Internalize the word (use imagination to see yourself living the truth)
- **T** - Talk with God (turn meditation into prayer)
- **A** - Apply the truth (ask: What should I know? Believe? Do?)
- **T** - Think on it throughout the day (keep muttering the word)
- **E** - Enjoy the Lord (delight in His Word and expect fruit)

The Bishop powerfully illustrates how to use imagination during meditation. If meditating on Jesus sleeping in the storm, don't identify with fearful disciples - see yourself sleeping peacefully like Jesus despite life's storms. This internalization moves truth from pages to head, to heart, to hands, to habits.

The sermon concludes with Psalm 1, describing the person who meditates day and night as a tree planted by rivers of water - stable, unmovable, fruitful in every season, and prosperous in all they do. The call to action is clear: Start meditating today. Don't be hearers only, but doers of the Word.

### 3. Prayer for Fulfilling God's Divine Assignment

**Focus:** Walking in prosperity and good success in God's purposes

**Prayer:** Lord, just as You gave Joshua a divine assignment to lead Israel into the Promised Land, You have given me a heavenly assignment for my life. I don't want to profit by gaining the whole world but losing my soul or failing to fulfill Your purpose. True prosperity is not measured by my bank account or the size of my house, but by successfully fulfilling Your assignment. I pray that as I meditate on Your Word day and night, You will empower me to carry out Your will in every area - as a spouse, as a parent, as an employee, as a believer. Let meditation give me the wisdom, strength, and character to represent Christ in all I do. According to Joshua 1:8, as I meditate on Your Word, I will make my way prosperous and have good success in accomplishing Your divine purposes.

**Scripture:** Joshua 1:8; Matthew 16:26 - "For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?"

### 4. Prayer for Stability and Fruitfulness

**Focus:** Becoming like a tree planted by rivers of water

**Prayer:** Father God, according to Psalm 1:2-3, the person whose delight is in Your law and who meditates in it day and night shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. Lord, I desire to be that tree - planted, stable, and unmovable. I don't want my emotions to be determined by my circumstances. When bad news comes, let me not be moved because I am rooted in Your goodness. When things are good, let me not be moved by temporary blessings but by Your eternal faithfulness. As I meditate on Your Word, make me fruitful in every season of life. Let my leaves never wither. Whatever I do, let it prosper because I am constantly drawing life from the river of Your Word. Let me bear fruit for Your glory - the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

**Scripture:** Psalm 1:2-3 - "But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper."

### 5. Prayer for Exchange of Thoughts

**Focus:** Replacing worldly thinking with God's thoughts

**Prayer:** Lord, Your Word declares in Proverbs 23:7 that as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. I recognize the power of my thoughts to shape my emotions, my behavior, and my life results. Father, I confess that my thoughts are not naturally Your thoughts, and my ways are not Your ways. Today I choose to exchange my thoughts for Yours through meditation on Your Word. Where I have been set on worry, reset my thermostat to peace. Where I have been set on fear, reset me to faith. Where I have been set on abandonment, reset me to Your constant presence. Where I have been set on worldly desires, reset me to hunger for righteousness. As I meditate on Your Word, let my brain be rewired so that I think like You, talk like You, walk like You, and act like You.

**Scripture:** Proverbs 23:7 - "For as he thinks in his heart, so is he"; Isaiah 55:8-9 - "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says the LORD."

### 6. Prayer for Victory Over Sinful Patterns

**Focus:** Breaking free from struggles through meditation

**Prayer:** Father, I acknowledge that I have areas where I keep struggling. There are behaviors I want to stop but keep doing, emotions I want to control but keep feeling. Today I receive the revelation that the solution is to take Your Word and meditate on it. If meditating on darkness can fundamentally change people in the wrong direction, then meditating on the light of Your Word has even more power to transform my desires toward godliness. I choose to stop trying to change in my own strength and to start meditating on Your truth day and night. As I do, I believe You will transform me on the inside. What once triggered negative emotions will lose its power as my experiences become connected to You and not to my past. Set me free through sustained meditation on Your liberating truth.

**Scripture:** John 8:32 - "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"; 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."

### 7. Prayer for Building Up and Receiving Inheritance

**Focus:** Being built up through the Word of His grace

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, according to Acts 20:32, Paul commended believers to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build us up and give us an inheritance among all who are sanctified. Lord, I receive this commendation. I commit myself to meditating on the Word of Your grace, knowing that by meditating on it, it will build me up. Build up my faith, build up my hope, build up my love. Through meditation, deliver to me the inheritance that is waiting for me - the inheritance of peace instead of anxiety, joy instead of depression, patience instead of anger, holiness instead of compromise. Without meditating on Your grace, I cannot expect to walk in my full inheritance. But as I meditate day and night, release everything You have prepared for me.

**Scripture:** Acts 20:32 - "So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified."

### 8. Prayer for Empowered Prayer and Worship

**Focus:** Meditation setting prayer and worship on fire

**Prayer:** Lord, I thank You that meditation is actually prayer and meditation is worship. But more than that, true meditation sets other prayers and forms of worship on fire. I confess that too often I have prayed without revelation, worshiped without understanding, and spoken empty words. Today I commit to meditating on Your goodness, Your greatness, Your love, Your grace, and Your promises before I pray and worship. Let meditation add fuel and fire to my prayers. Let meditation ignite my worship with genuine revelation and passion. As I meditate on Your Word day and night, let every prayer I pray be filled with faith that comes from hearing Your Word. Let every song I sing be filled with the revelation of who You are.

**Scripture:** Romans 10:17 - "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."

### 9. Prayer for Using Imagination for Internalization

**Focus:** Moving truth from head to heart to hands to habits

**Prayer:** Father, thank You for giving me the gift of imagination. I recognize that the fastest way to get Your Word from my head to my heart to my hands to my habits is to use my imagination to envision what Your Word is saying. When I meditate on Jesus sleeping in the storm, let me see myself sleeping peacefully despite the waves. When I meditate on meekness and gentleness, let me see myself responding calmly when provoked. When I meditate on courage and faith, let me see myself walking in victory. Holy Spirit, open the eyes of my heart as I meditate. Give me visions of Your truth. Help me to see myself not as I am, but as You are transforming me to be. Let me internalize Your Word so deeply that it becomes my automatic response in every situation.

**Scripture:** Ephesians 1:18 - "The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling."

---

### 10. Prayer for the Lord as Shepherd

**Focus:** Meditating on God's care and provision (Psalm 23:1)

**Prayer:** The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. Father, as I meditate on this truth, I ask: Who is this Lord? He is Jesus, the Son of God, the Resurrection and the Life, my Shepherd. What does it mean that You are my Shepherd? It means You protect me, guide me, feed me, and care for me. Why is it a benefit for You to be my Shepherd? Because You are perfect in faithfulness and love. When is the Lord my Shepherd? You are my Shepherd NOW, in present tense - not just in the past or future, but right now in this moment. How does it feel to have You as my Shepherd? I feel secure, peaceful, and provided for. Even when I face lions and giants, I have courage because my Shepherd is by my side. I shall not want for wisdom, peace, provision, protection, or anything I need. You are my Shepherd, and that is enough.

**Scripture:** Psalm 23:1 - "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want."

### 11. Prayer for Practical Meditation Practice

**Focus:** Implementing the practical steps of biblical meditation

**Prayer:** Lord, I commit to practicing biblical meditation using the framework You've revealed through this teaching. Help me to Muse silently on Your Word, turning truth over in my mind. Help me to Mutter softly, whispering Your promises under my breath. Help me to Mouth it strongly, speaking Your Word aloud with confidence. Help me to Memorize Your truth so I can recall it throughout the day. Empower me to Make time for meditation, Embrace silence and stillness, Determine my focus on Your truth, Dig deep by asking questions, Internalize Your Word through imagination, Talk with You in prayer, Apply what I learn, Think on it continually, and Enjoy You as I delight in Your law. Let meditation become my habit, my practice, my way of life.

**Scripture:** Philippians 4:8 - "Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things."

### 12. Prayer for Being a Doer of the Word

**Focus:** Moving from hearing to doing through meditation

**Prayer:** Father, Your Word says in James 1:22, "Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." I don't want to be a hearer only. I don't want to come to church, hear a good sermon, say "Amen," and then forget everything I heard. Today I commit to being a doer of Your Word. I will not leave this revelation on the pages of my Bible or in my notes. I will take what has been cooked for me and eat it. I will chew on it, digest it, and let it nourish my spirit. I will start meditating today - not tomorrow, not next week, but today. Whether I take a verse from this sermon or cook my own meal in Your presence, I commit to sustained focus on Your truth until it transforms me. Let this church become brand new as we all commit to meditating on Your Word day and night. Make us like trees planted by rivers of water, stable, fruitful, and prosperous in fulfilling Your will.

**Scripture:** James 1:22 - "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves"; Psalm 1:1-3 (full passage).

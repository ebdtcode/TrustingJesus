All right, Father, we thank you for your word. I shall now return to you, Void. We thank you that you will speak in and through us and you will give your people understanding even as you give me utterance. I trust you, Holy Spirit, for you are here to do the will of the Father. In Jesus' name. So last week, we spoke to you on the subject of what? Meditation. Amen? How many of you were here? Okay, it looks like, come on, raise your hand. I'm going to get a sense of how many were here. Look, like 50% of you. The other 50% you were not here, and I hope you had a good reason for not being here. Other than you just didn't want to get out of bed. Okay, because some days of Lord's Day and we ought to gather together to worship and amen. But whatever reason you didn't, you were not here. Thank God for technology. That message is recorded. You can view it on YouTube. And if you haven't subscribed to our channel, to my channel, to the churches YouTube channel, encourage you to do that because you can listen to these sermons over and over again, all right? But do that and go and listen to it because it is critical for your well-being, all right? We spoke to you last Sunday on the subject of what? Meditation. In our text on that Sunday, the foundation text was what? John chapter one, verse eight. And this is what we read. This book of the law shall not do what? Joshua, excuse me. This book, you say I was testing you, I need you. You guys are listening, you're meditating, amen? This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein and then you will make your way prosperous and you'll have good success, amen? That passage focuses on the importance and the priority that you and I should give to meditation. Are you listening to me? The Lord was instructing Joshua on how to successfully fulfill his assignment because Joshua had just received this huge responsibility from God that was to replace Moses as the leader of Israel and to take Israel into the Promised Land facing all of the giants, the Kirinized Jericho. That was a tough assignment, but that was God's will for Joshua. And God says to Joshua, knowing what Joshua was about to do and the battles that he was going to fight, God says to Joshua, Joshua, this is what you need to do to be successful and prosperous in carrying out my assignment. If you want to carry out my assignment successfully and fulfill that assignment, this is what's going to be required. He didn't say Joshua, you need to master the art of warfare. Joshua, you need to learn and train your people how to use the sword. Now, those things have their place but that was not where God placed the emphasis. God said, Joshua, here's a secret. Here's the thing that if you do this, I guarantee you you will fulfill your assignment. You will carry out my will. You will be successful in carrying out my will. You will prosper in carrying out my will. Whatever the assignment I had given you, Joshua, this is the secret to accomplishing it. Take my word and meditate on it day and night. Not just look at it, not just read it. Meditate on it and meditate on it day and night. In other words, make it your habit, make it your practice on a daily basis as often as you can throughout the day. Make it your practice, Joshua, to meditate on my word. And if you will do this, Joshua, you, by that decision, will ensure that you will prosper and experience good success in doing my will, okay? I know many times we'll read that and it was your prosperous success. It means if I do this, I'm gonna have a mansion. I'm gonna drive Mercedes-Benz. I'm gonna become a millionaire. That's not what God was saying to Joshua. Well, God was saying to Joshua, if you do this, you will be successful in prosperous, incurring out and fulfilling my assignment for your life, my heavenly assignment. Isn't that what you want? Watch your man profit he gains the whole world and loses his soul. What does a man profit he gains the whole world and doesn't fulfill the assignment that God gave him? You and I should be living every day to fulfill that assignment. Amen, and the man who fulfills that assignment is truly prosperous. The man who fulfills that assignment is truly blessed. The man who fulfills that assignment is truly prosperous. Don't measure success and prosperity by your bank account or by the size of your house. Do you hear me? Amen, God blesses us with things to enjoy, richly with things to enjoy. That is the fringe benefit. That is not the core. Amen, the most important thing you can do with your life and the reason you're on earth for how long God will allow you to be on earth is to accomplish a particular assignment for His glory. I hear me and the way you accomplish that, they think that you must not miss is that meditating on the Word of God is essential. So say to your neighbor, I'm going to meditate on God's work. Day and night. Amen, so let me repeat. Meditation is God's chosen method for transforming our hearts and minds and causing us to experience good success in carrying out His divine will and assignments daily. You know, if you're married, you have an assignment concerning your spouse. Meditation will empower you to fulfill that assignment daily. If you are an employer and employee, you have an assignment there to represent and reflect Christ. In all you do, meditating will empower you to fulfill that assignment there. In every area God has an assignment and you want to fulfill that assignment on a daily basis and the key to that is to make meditating on God's Word essential, right? And when we talk about meditating on God's Word, again, we're distinguishing it from reading. Reading has this place. Reading will give you information but meditation will produce what? Transformation. Say reading God's Word gives me knowledge or information. Meditating transforms me. Reading information, meditation, transformation and what God is looking for is to transform you into the image of Jesus, Hallelujah. So if you have to choose only one of the spiritual disciplines to focus on, if you had to choose between meditation and prayer and worship, I said to you last week, choose meditation. Because again, God didn't say to Joshua, if you want to prosper here, I want you to pray day and night. I want you to worship day and night. Now, we know prayer and worship, very important, but that's not my God's Word Joshua. God said Joshua, I want you to meditate on my Word day and night. Now ask yourself, how much are you meditating on God's Word? Do you think if you were Joshua, God would have told you anything differently? I don't think so, he would have told you the same thing. And today, when we come to him with our challenges in our marriages, as spouses, as parents of children, as business people, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, if you were to come to God and ask God for his best advice, though nothing God says should be treated simply as advice, but if you ask God, God, what should I do? I guarantee you God will first of all reinforce to you how important it is for you to meditate in his Word day and night. Question, church, are you meditating day and night on God's Word? And if you're not, it explains why you're not being transformed. It explains why you're not experiencing good success in that area. It explains why you keep struggling and struggling struggling because you're trying to change in your own strength. You're trying to win the battle, so you're fighting in your own mind. And God said, you know what? You go ahead and start meditating upon my Word. What happens when you meditate on God's Word is that the Word of God transforms you. And on the inside, and that is what you want to happen. And that is what God wants to happen. God wants your change to be from the inside out. And it is the Word of God when meditating upon day and night that will transform you on the inside. It'll transform the way you think and then the way you believe and then the way you feel and then the way you behave. Because when you get changed, when your thoughts in the heart are changed, the emotions are changed. Because our emotions are tied to our thinking. We still here, you're tracking your following, right? Our emotions are tied to our thinking. And then when our emotions get changed, our behavior follows because emotions have a lot to do with the way you behave. The reason you talk to me badly, or I talk to you badly is because you heard my feelings. My feelings provoke my angry response. I hear me. So, since I want to change my behavior because my behavior will change the results I get in life, I gotta go backward, okay? Results are the result of behavior. Behavior is largely influenced by emotions and emotions. I influenced my thoughts. I need to change my thoughts. So that eventually my behavior changes. All right, we can do, come on. Everyone of you should be clapping now, amen? So you prioritize meditation because of the impact and meditation has upon us in changing us and transforming us. Hallelujah, and we wanna do it day and night. It needs to become a habit, all right? So again, God places a huge, a huge power to our meditation. Even before prayer, even before worship, because meditation is in fact prayer and meditation is in fact worship. And true meditation actually sets other prayers and other forms of worship on fire. If you just worship without meditating, I told you last week you're worshiping without revelation. And if you're worshiping without revelation, it's just empty words. Try meditating upon God's goodness and greatness and then worship. And you will see how it adds fuel and fire to your worship. Amen? Try meditating on God's word and God's goodness, God's love, God's grace, God's promises. And then pray and you will see how meditating ignites your prayer and sets it on fire, amen? So one more time, let's repeat this book of the law. Now for us, book of the law really for us is the word of grace. Paul said, I commit you to God and to the word of his grace which will build you up and give you your heritists. Let's repeat that. I commit you or commend you to God and the word of his grace which will do what? Build you up and do what? Give you your inheritance is waiting for you but God says the way you're gonna receive that inheritance is by means of the word of his grace. So when Paul said I commend you to God and the word of his grace, he's saying meditate on the word of his grace because by meditating on the word of his grace it will build you up. One of the things that will build is your faith. It will build your hope. It will build your love. How you hear me? It will build you up and do what? Deliver your inheritance to you which means without meditating on God's grace don't expect to walk in your inheritance. Said it only about I have inheritance that I'm gonna walk on, walking this, excuse me. Peace is my inheritance. Joy is my inheritance. I hear me, patience. You don't have to always be losing your temper so I was born in September. Hey man, hey man, your inheritance is peace. You don't have to get angry and upset and then you create stresses in your body that causes your blood pressure to go up. Hey man, you get angry, you're not forgiving, you create stresses in your body that causes you to constrict and then you develop arthritis and all kinds of stuff. I'm not saying everybody who got arthritis years. But your emotions do affect your body. They call it psychosomatic diseases, right? And man, there are diseases that develop on a body that can be traced directly to our thinking. All right, God tells Joshua to perfect the art of meditation and to do it day and night. Because what happens in your mind determines or influences what happens in your life. It's not the soul determinant, there's some things that you don't control. But what happens in your mind is gonna impact your behaviors and your behavior will determine and impact what you experience in life. That's just a reality. Trouble would come, Jesus says they will. How you respond to that trouble will determine the results ultimately that you obtain. So trouble can cause you to become crazy. A trouble can eventually produce a joy and a peace in your heart that passeth all understanding. So here I mean guys, let's not be here as of the word only. Let's be what? And what is the word that we're gonna do? We're gonna start meditating in God's word. How often? That means all the time. Never stop meditating, meditate all the time. Now what is biblical meditation? It is that spirit-led practice of focusing your mind or your thoughts on God or on God's word or God's truth to focus your mind and your thoughts on God's word, God's truth, God's revelation. In a sustained manner, until it transforms the way you think, the way you believe and the way you behave. The goal of this meditation is to exchange your thoughts for God's. What is the goal? To exchange your thoughts for God's. Because He says my ways are not one of your ways. My thoughts are not your thoughts. You see, we get born again and we got all kinds of thoughts and attitudes that we brought with us. And when you are born again, the Bible says you become a new creature. All things are what pass the way and all things become new. But this refers to your spirit. Your spirit becomes brand new. But you know, not everything changes when you get saved. If you had a big nose, you still have one. If you had a big lips, you still have one. If you had whatever, if you had too much, whatever, you still got too much. If you have enough, you still got enough. In other words, physically nothing changes. Immediately, right? But there's a brand new change that takes place in your spirit. You become literally brand new. You actually in your spirit start to partake of the nature of Jesus. Say hallelujah. The scripture says, as he is so are you in your spirit. But you know that two other parts of you. One is your soul, that is your mind, your will and your emotions. Are you still here? And then the other is your body, right? So your spirit has changed now because you want to be conformed to the image of Jesus. You gotta start exchanging your thoughts which are not instantly different or transformed. You now want to exchange those thoughts that you have for the thoughts of God. You say, why is it important that I exchange my thoughts for the thoughts of God? Because scripture says in the book of Proverbs, I think it's chapter 23 for seven. As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Why do I want to exchange my thoughts for God? Because of the power of thoughts. As a man thinketh in his heart. So he is, in other words, the way the brain is trained to think is gonna affect the way you behave. I told you last week that the brain is like a thermostat. If you set the thermostat on 75 degrees, the temperature in the room will become 75 degrees. If the thermostat in your brain is set odd feelings of abandonments, you will experience feelings of abandonment. If the thermostat in your brain is set on worry, you will experience worry. If you set on fear, you will experience fear. So you want to exchange your thoughts for God because if you exchange your thoughts for God and the thermostat in your brain is set on God. It's set on the promises of God. It's set on the character of God. It's set on the purposes of God. It's set on the goodness of God. It's set on the faithfulness of God. It's set on the presence of God. It's set on the plan of God. Are you hearing me? It's set on God. And when your brain thermostat is set on God, it affects your feelings and affects your behavior. Listen to me, thoughts are extremely powerful. Thoughts can change your behavior, can change your emotions, can change your life for good or for bad, depending upon what you choose to focus your thoughts on. Hear me, how many of you have observed recently that seems to be a tremendous increase in people claiming to be lesbians and homosexuals? Oh, you don't want to raise your hand? I mean, it's strange. So what are men, all of a sudden, everybody coming out? Where were these people before? Were they all undercover? Or are there actually more people, more men now being attracted to men than before, more women being attracted to women than before? More people want to change who they are sexually, want to start dressing like men even though they're biological women. Where is this coming from? Is it true that all of them were, that they were born this way? You know, I heard something just last week because I was asking myself that, what's happening? And I really believe the Lord opened my eyes to see if this is on the only course, but suddenly I think this is the major course for all of a sudden, what's happening? Is, you know what, your brain can be wired and rewired. Let me share, you know, there was a lady who shared her story a little years ago. She realized that from Friday to Sunday, she would be very happy. But as soon as Monday comes, weekdays from Monday to Thursday, she'll be depressed. Sad. Then the weekend will come and it seems that all the burdens are gone as she's happy. Then Monday shows up and from Monday to Thursday, she's sad. And she didn't know what was happening. She was a Christian. And the Lord opened her eyes to see why this was the case. Growing up as a child, her father was always away from Monday to Thursday. He wasn't at home. As a Monday to Thursday, she was at home with her dad who missed her father and began to feel a sense of loneliness and eating abandonment because dad was never there Monday to Thursday, but Friday, dad came home. And so from Friday to Sunday, dad was there. She wasn't feeling abandoned. She felt secure her dad was there. But Monday, dad has to go and once again, when dad leaves the sense of being alone, sense of being abandoned, she would experience that, leading her to being sad. And over a course of time, you keep repeating that the brain gets wired to connect Monday to Wednesday to Thursday Friday with feelings or a sense of abandonment. So now, even though she's an adult and the circumstances have changed, every Monday, their brain has been wired to connect Monday to Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to abandonment. And because the brain has connected those days to abandonment, the feelings associated with abandonment is sadness. But it comes and the brain has connected Friday with dad's presence. And so even though circumstances physically have changed, the brain is still wired. That explains why some of us, when we hear about an airplane going to fly, we get afraid. On certain words, somebody speaks that word and we find ourselves overreacting, because in our brain, whatever just happened is connected to something bad. For which you feel you need to protect yourself. Your thoughts are powerful. And the brain is wired by your experiences and by the things you continue to focus on in such a way that certain things would trigger certain actions. And here's the good news and we'll talk about that. Your brain can be rewired. So your brain, say, my brain can be rewired. One more time, my brain can be rewired. That is what is called renewing your mind in Romans chapter 12. I be seated there for bread and by the mercess of God to be what? Transformed by the no longer be conformed to this world. This, the brain has been wired over time to think and respond to problems and challenges and things in your environment like the world changes or the world responds. And for us to listen, you can now rewire your brain. It's called renewing your mind. And he says, this is the method, this is the process. This is what you do to renew a rewire the brain meditate on my word. So if there's any stuff happening in your brain that causes you to not be walking in the peace of God or the joy of the Lord, of the victory of Christ, you need to understand that because it's something in your brain has been wired a certain way, but here's a good news for the help of the Holy Spirit and the decision of your will. You can begin to rewire your brain so that those things that once triggered negative emotions lose their power because now those experiences are connected to God and not to your past. I'm preaching better than you're listening. I'm helping you more than you're admitting. Come and raise your hands and thank you Jesus. Continue to teach us. So what's happening in the homosexual peace? Why is it all, I mean, everywhere you turn, it looks like they're everywhere. That sounded kind of bad, but, but yes, you know, and I don't want to sound bad. I just want to share what I think is happening. I believe one of the reasons, I'm saying the major reason for all of these folks showing up as the eye, young ladies who grew up normally and the next time, before you know it, they say they're lesbian, young boys that grew up and before you know it, they say they're homosexuals and trap. What's happening? I believe it's due to the power of meditation. I believe their brains are being rewired. By what? Pornography. You see, there was a time when you know what we were growing up, you didn't have pornography everywhere. And when you did see anybody, it was usually between a man and a woman. So if they trickered anything, it was natural desires. But now these folks have this thing on their phones and young children. I'm talking about the power of imagination, thoughts, meditation. And I don't know, but once or twice a day whatever, they're looking at that stuff and they're not just fancy. They're focusing, they're meditating. They're meditating upon a man with a man. And that meditation is intensified by the fact that they're actually seeing it. So it's not just imagining it, it's seeing it but they're meditating on it. So the man is seeing and meditating on a man with a man. His brain is being rewired. If a woman is meditating a child, a young boy, a young girl, who had natural desires? Because he was born with his brain properly wired to connect him and his natural attractions to a female. But he begins to see this perversion and begins to meditate on it and all of a sudden the brain starts to rewire itself so that the natural affection that he should have for a woman is now being transferred by the brain to a man. And the same thing with females. So all of a sudden now after you've done meditate enough, you have changed. Unfortunately in the wrong way. So that now your natural attractions are no longer for the opposite sex. Your natural affections now are for your own kind because you spent all this time exposing your mind and rewiring your mind in such a way that your natural attractions now go the opposite. And then you hear people say, well, I can't help myself. That's the way I am. As a man thinking that it's hard, so is he. So yeah, this is the way they have become. But they became this way because they expose their minds and meditate it upon this stuff to such a degree that the mind has been rewired. And now when they see a man, they're triggered by a man. Or she sees a woman, she's triggered by a woman because her mind has been rewired. But here's a good news. If meditating on darkness can change you in such a way that you start to desire the things of darkness than meditating on light. Say hallelujah. If meditating on lies can change you so fundamentally that you start to be attracted to things that are not natural then meditating on the truth of God's word has the power, I want to say even more power, to change and transform your desires so that you begin to desire light and not darkness. Are you hear me? So that you start to love the things of God rather than the things of the world. But the key is you need to do what God told Joshua is to. All his day and so if you're struggling in any area in terms I want to do this when I keep doing this I want to, I keep feeling this. Hear me here is the solution. Take the word of God and meditate in it. Now we're not talking about just reading or hear it like you come and hear a sermon and that's done. Meditation requires, it's not complicated but it requires focus. It requires focus, sustain focus. Focus and tell you begin to feel it. You know you really meditate and now when what you have meditating on you actually start to feel you know what's your emotion start to become impacted by what you're meditating on. You know you've meditated on this verse long enough when you start to feel joy or peace or hope start to rise of you start to feel positive. You know you're meditating and the word of God is beginning to impact you. And you can do this and the more you do this the quicker you begin to experience the effect. But at first for some of us who haven't done this there'll be a struggle. But if you will make time to focus on the word and to meditate upon the thoughts, exchanging your thoughts for God's you will experience an inward change that will ultimately change the results that you're getting in Jesus' name. You may not change the people, you may not change the circumstances, but you'll be changed. And because you are changed you're gonna respond differently and you're gonna get different results for yourself if not for anybody else. And now the people who are clapping they're meditating. Because they're feeling it right? All right now so you need to do that with the scriptures and you need to do that with the word. The key is to define out the truth and meditate upon the truth. And so one way to discover the truth and the best way is to take the word read it and read it and read it. Hey man, in a sense you feed yourself with food you make you know you cook your own food and then you eat it. How many of you, nobody cooks for you, you cook for yourself, right? I saw a husband there. I saw a husband there. I saw a husband by the way that said his wife looked at him and he put his head back. If I told you I cook for myself I'll be lying. So I don't cook for myself by wife cooks and then I eat and I eat good while she has cooked. Thank God I have a wife who can cook good, right? Now she can cook the food and tell me it's ready if she gets upset right now because as soon as the food ready I must come. I came to finish what I'm doing. Once she says the food is ready if I don't get up immediately and go and eat I got trouble on my head. Even though she knows I don't complain her food is always good but I'm gonna stop whatever I'm talking about I'm gonna stop. That's five minutes. If I wait five minutes I'm in trouble. But she wants me to eat it and I need to eat it, right? In order for it to do me good. In this case I don't have to prepare but thank God many of you do prepare your food and then you feed on it. It is the same way with the word. Right now I prepared this meal. You didn't I cooked this for you. Amen? You were doing your own thing yesterday and you were doing your own thing Friday and you were doing your own thing last night. I was cooking. Say hallelujah. Say Bishop you cook well, you cook well last night. I was cooking, swatching and cooking. I hear me but hopefully the meal that is being served is good. But now you have a responsibility to take what has been cooked for you and eat it. And I give you five minutes and if you don't do it in five minutes you're out of being trouble. Ha ha ha ha. Don't let me talk to you on Wednesday and you haven't eaten my meal yet. Come on take it. It was cooked and prepared and if it's good meal then eat it. And that means you chew on it and you chew on it and you chew on it and you chew on it, you digest it. It meant that's good but all of us will get to the place where we can enjoy somebody else's food that has been cooked but that we also are able to cook our own meals and enjoy and digest what we have cooked in the presence of God that was strengthen us and cause us to experience good success, okay? So now I want us to get real practical. Let's go to my, I got a little PowerPoint I'm going to rush through it but I want to give you something and I think that's going to be a way for you to take it home and use it. So I just want to give you some practical steps. On last week I used the example of warring. I said if you know how to worry you know how to meditate but I want to just give you another way of thinking about it. These things are all important but you know it's not a certain order you're going to see them in an order doesn't mean this is the order you have to do it but these are all elements that hopefully will help you to now begin to practice daily meditation. Are you ready? All right so just walk me through this. So here are some practical steps. And here is one way to look at what you do when you meditate, okay? Mews, same mews, silently. You know what you get along with the word and with God and you begin to mews. That means you take that verse or that thought or that truth whatever it is that you're going to be meditating on and you just turn it over. You just turn that truth over. You turn that verse over. You just think about it. Let it roll through your mind. You think about what you're reading you think about the truth you heard today and just begin to ponder on it and think about it, let the thoughts arise. You know of course you begin all of this with prayer but that's musing. You're just going over it in your mind. Some of the things Bishop said you know that's why good illustration is so effective because you tend to remember technically illustrations go over in your mind. All right? I've said a number of things but then maybe one or two truths and really you know really you believe came from the word take it ponder it. Don't just leave your goal and forget about it. Make time to what? Think about it in your mind. Roll that thought over and over in your mind. Then mutter the actual Hebrew word for meditation is actually to mutter to involves using the mouth, right? So begin to mutter it. For instance, if the word is this book of the law shall not meditate, shall not depart from your mouth. You can begin to mutter it, this book, this word, this word, this word of grace, shall not. But you say quietly, I'm saying that a lot because I want you here but it's where it is. It's almost like you're whispering it, okay? But you keep whispering it. The key is to keep repeating. There's something about repetition that is important to meditation. So you take that thing that you thought about and then you begin to mutter it quietly under your breath, whispering. There at some point, move from just whispering to mouthing it strongly. You always open them out and start to say it. Say it strongly. Say it with confidence, okay? This book of the law, this word of grace, shall not, shall not depart from my mouth because I shall meditate, I shall meditate day and night. I shall meditate day and night. I shall meditate day and night. You understand? You begin to mouth it aloud so that you're both saying it and you're hearing it, repeat that. The key is what, to repeat it. And then number four, memorize. In other words, you don't memorize the verse or memorize the thought or memorize the truth, okay? And then store that in the heart. You want to memorize it so that it's there so that you can recall it. Because you don't wanna do this once. If you spend 15 minutes or 20 minutes just meditating on Joshua 1.8, then you gotta get up because you gotta go, right? You gotta go to work, you gotta take care of all of that. You gotta do that. But if you have memorized the thought so that you can recall it, then throughout the day, as you're doing other things, you can always do what? Recall it and you can mutter it. If you were people, you don't have to be speaking so loud that they can hear it. But you can actually be under your breath. Throughout the day, this word of grace, this word of grace shall not be part of my eyes. I shall meditate upon it. I am meditating upon it. You follow me? So you wanna memorize the truth or the truths? Store it so you can recall it throughout the day. So quickly, let's go through this. Muse, everybody, no go back, please. Muse, silently, mutter, softly, mouth it strongly, memorize it. You can use this outline as a short outline to help you remember the major parts of meditation. Let's go to another outline. This is longer. It just reinforces these things, but it highlights some other things that I want you to know. So what I did, I took the word meditate and I created an acronym that I believe it again highlights for you what's important when it comes to meditation. And when you say, I'm gonna meditate, these are the things that you're deciding you're gonna do, okay? All right, see everybody taking it, taking it. That's good, go ahead and take it. No, that's fine. But here's the first thing. When you meditate, you wanna do what? You got to, if you're gonna meditate day and night guys, you're gonna have to make time. You're gonna have to decide. You're gonna have to make time to be alone with God and His Word. Our schedules are all different, so you choose what works for you. Some people would say, I'm gonna meditate 6 a.m. every morning from six to six, or from six to six, 15 or from six to seven o'clock. And it's gonna work for them. If it's gonna work for you, then make up your mind today every morning at six o'clock. Somebody else would say, it doesn't matter when I wake up, but the first thing I do when I wake up, I'm gonna meditate. So if you sleep long, you get up, the first thing you're gonna do is meditate. So you may tie your meditation, not necessarily about a particular hour, but just after a particular activity. You follow me? The key is don't just leave it and hope it happens, because if you leave it, a simple hope meditation will happen, I guarantee you, there will be so many things that will take your time that you will not engage in deep meditation. Is that so? All right, so that's where it starts. A life of victory and success. If you want to fulfill God's assignment, experience, prosperity, and good success in doing the will of God, say I have to make time for meditation. Amen, make time. To E, embrace silence and stillness. I know we forecast what charismatic people, sometimes we think silence is of the devil. You know, we think silence is fleshly, all right? Talking and action, that's spiritual. But hear me, you know, Jesus will often get up in the morning. The Bible says a long while before day and he will go to be alone. What was he embraced in solitude, silence and stillness? So wherever you choose to meditate, to really engage in deep meditation, you need to find a place where you can be silence, still, and by yourself. It's wonderful for us to be together and there are times when we must be together. But then there are times when spiritual growth requires solitude, silence, stillness. Jesus says, open the door of your closet, shut the door. And what was he saying, basically, delimited distractions, outward distractions, inward distractions? I don't know. For you and me nowadays, I think that cell phone is extremely good, but it's probably your number one enemy. It's mine, okay? And I assume that it's probably your number one enemy that really, really hinders silence and stillness. Because even when you close the door in your closet, you take the phone with you. And the phone is not on airplane mode or something. You got it on and still you're praying. And you take a look at him more closely. Who said from, I wonder why he calling me? Oh, I need to call him. You've been interrupted. You put it down. There's an email that has come. I'm going to talk about so for us guys, for most of us, one of the first things we got to remove from our space when it comes to meditation is our electronic stuff we have. Either cut it off or put it on silence where you can't interrupt you. Because if you take it with you, it's going to prevent you from truly being alone. Because all the people who have access to your number you brought them with you. All right? D. Determine your focus. Well, let me say something. Other embrace stillness and silence include quiet worship. All right? So you're still, you're silent, you're with God by yourself. At some point you can enter into silent worship because one of the ways to be still on my soul, one of the ways to steal the inner voices and noises is through worship. Not loud worship, not silent, quiet worship, soft worship. Okay? Because that will help you to steal the inner noises. Leaving your phone outside will help you steal the outward noises. But the inner noises can be distracting too. You've got to find a way to shut that bottle mouth that you keep hearing when you're in the prayer closet. Because he keeps making noise in your head. D. So now when you're still in your worshiping and you're just in the Lord's presence, often he will direct, often you will get a thought that directs you to a particular verse if you don't already have a verse. Sometimes you're going to the prayer closet already knowing what you're going to meditate on. But if you don't know what you're going to meditate on, while you're worshiping and while you're just enjoying his presence, thoughts will come to your mind that will direct you to a particular verse of scripture or particular truth or particular aspects of God's character. Right? You have to determine now what you're going to spend your time focusing on. What truth? What text? Are you going to focus on for the next 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, depending on how long you're going to be there? Determine that. And what you determine that start to dig. What do I mean? Begin to ask questions. Are you following me? Am I giving you too much? You're listening? Okay. What you want to do now, say you determine that the text of the truth you're going to meditate on, is the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Say that. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want that verse. That's all you're going to meditate on. Right? So you've determined that's the verse. Now you want to dig. You want to dig to see what God wants to say. Then what will help you to dig questions? That's a great answer. I'll also say, is it a four eight W's or five W's and one and eight? Ask questions. Who? The Lord. Who? Who is this Lord? Jesus. But who is Jesus? Son of God. But who is Jesus? That's a rational life. But who is Jesus? My shepherd? You begin to ask questions. Who? What? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. What does that mean for the Lord to be my shepherd? What? That's a shepherd Jew. Why is it a benefit for the Lord to be my shepherd and ask someone else? Why is it better for the Lord to be my shepherd and not my job? You see? Now, that thought just came to me. It wasn't in my mind before I came. But I'm actually meditating. I'm digging. And as I ask these questions, my mind is opening up more to appreciate what it means to have the Lord ask my shepherd. Say, what? Who? How? When? When is the Lord my shepherd? Is it after I die? When is the Lord my shepherd? Is it sometime in the past? The Lord is. That's that. Oh, that's present tense. I'm meditating. Oh, none of these things were in my mind. But because I'm digging, all of these things are coming. Wow. Present tense. Now, what does it mean? How does it feel to have him, my shepherd? What does a shepherd do? A shepherd protects. Whoa. Wow. I feel like to know the Lord is protecting me now. Now, I can see myself in a situation where there was lions, and I will normally be afraid. But now I see the Lord is with me. I see the shepherd is by my side. How do I feel when I'm facing a lion for the shepherd is by my side? Am I afraid? No. I'm full of courage because I know the shepherd is protecting me. So you're digging by asking questions. What, who, where, when, how? Why? All right? So important. Now, here is something I suggest. I suggest that as these revelations or new thoughts begin to come to you, record them. Write them down. So have a little notebook so you can just jot the thought down. Because what you want to do next is you want to internalize. That's what I say internalize. I want to do what? E. Journalize. The word in other words, I want to digest it. Okay? I was asking questions. I was getting good information. I was getting knowledge. I was getting truth. But I don't want to leave the truth on the paper. I want the truth on the paper to get inside of me. Please listen. Here's what happens when you're meditating. What should be happening? The truth that is before you. That which you are seeing or you are hearing. You want that truth to move from your eyes or from your ears. You want to move that truth into your head. Man, the way you're looking. I don't know. All right. Move your truth. Move that truth from the pages or from the sermon. Into your head. Then you want it to travel from your head to your heart. Then you want it to travel from your heart to your hands. Where you're doing it. And then you want to travel from your hand to your habits. So this is something that you are habitually doing. And that's why you must internalize it. Because if you do that internalize it, it will not move from the pages or from the sermon to your head, to your heart, to your hands, and to your habits. So now you want to do that internalize the words. So the thoughts that you have written, you want now to begin to think and repeat and think and repeat. And this is where you use your imagination. If you're taking notes right that down. This is where you use your imagination. To actually internalize the truth, you use your imagination. That is what quite God gave you, your imagination. The fastest way to get the word from your head to your heart to your hands to your life is to use your imagination. In our envision, what the word is talking about. The Bible says, the Holy Spirit will give visions. The Holy Spirit guides us in the truth, right? But the scripture says he will give visions. In other words, one of the primary ways by which the Holy Spirit can communicate and review truth to you is by opening the eyes of your heart and helping you to see what the word is saying, right? So here is when you ask the Lord, Lord helping to see what I'm reading. So if Jesus, if the disciples are on the boat and there's a storm raging, what do you want to see? The disciples on the boat, the storm raging, and they are afraid. Then you want to see Jesus. What is Jesus doing? You want to see Jesus in that same storm? Imagine it, envision it. What are the sounds you're hearing? And some of you who are creative. This is where you can have a lot of fun. The sounds, you can see the waves, you can see the boat. You see the disciples afraid, but you're looking the corner of the boat, and you don't know what. Now, which one are you going to identify with? Are you going to identify with the disciples? If you do, and you see yourself, like one of the disciples, you're going to start up some real fear. And you're going to start trembling. But if you look at Jesus and say, oh no, I'm identifying with Jesus. That's the image God wants to conform me to. So now you see Jesus living, and where do you see yourself? You don't see yourself with the rest of these disciples. You see yourself leaning down and sleeping. The boat is going up. Don't see the sea calm, because right now your life isn't calm. See the storm that is happening. But see yourself sleeping, resting, not afraid, calm. And every time you're tempted to be afraid, you look over and you see Jesus. So am I. What are you doing? You are internalizing the word, so that the word starts to transform the way you think, the way you believe, the way you feel, and ultimately the way you behave. When you get through that, you get up and the storm is still raging. That experience you had has already started to change you. You may have to do that every day for a while, until the full effect is manifested. Do it the same way you are getting with your temper, your anger. If you always get angry because somebody criticizes you, is that the image of Christ? How are you going to change where, instead of becoming angry, you are weak. You are strong, but your emotions are under your control. How are you going to be transformed? Tell me. Tell me. Everybody should answer. Tell me. You are going to look at Jesus, or look at a scripture that calls you to weakness, to gentleness, and you are going to meditate on that word, dig in deep. I will tell you that you get enough revelation from that word, you write it down, and then you make that what you are going to focus your thoughts on and engage your imagination. Amen? So if now the Lord is calling you to be gentle, but your natural response from the old man is to be angry, go ahead and take the person who makes you angry the most, see that person doing what he has to always does to make you angry. But this time imagine yourself doing the word. Imagine yourself not striking back, not yelling, not having to defend yourself, imagine yourself responding calmly. Imagine yourself on the cross, say, Father, forgive them. They know not what they do. Are you hear me? Yes, so instead of seeing yourself being angry, change the picture. The person is there, they are doing what they do, and here you are acting like Jesus. Father, forgive them. They know not what they do. Here you are acting like Stephen. Oh, Father, don't lay this to their charge. That's the image of Christ. And right now when you're angry, you're not acting out who you are. You are that in your spirit, but it's not being expressed openly. By meditating when you see yourself fulfilling scripture, doing what God requires you to do, your brain will get we wide. And just like people become aware of something they were not born to be because of meditation, all of a sudden what was not natural to you? Yeah, you were born in September. Yeah, September people are known for having quick temper. And by the way, I was born in September. And there was a time. I don't know, I need to meditate still a little bit more, but there was a time. It was not easy for me to cut you. That was a Christian. Much younger. I was still in my teenage years. But there were just certain things that would trigger me. And I had some very rare words that would come out of my mouth. But those words have been come out of my mouth down for decades. What? My image of my self-change through meditation. I didn't just hear the word, I internalized. Man, I used to, there was a day of the, what do you call it tape, the cassette. I used to take sermons and listen to sermons over and that's why I don't understand y'all. Seriously, I mean, you got quite a word of this place and you don't listen, you hardly listen when it's being spoken. Then you don't even bother to take it again and, hey, how do you expect your growing change? How do you expect your ever become fully mature if you don't prioritize the word and meditating in the word? How do you expect to change? There's some things you tolerate in your life right now. The only reason you tolerate it because you don't meditate. If you meditate it in God's word, your image of yourself was so changed that you said, I can't do that. I cannot wear that. I cannot go out looking like this. I cannot say those words. I cannot let that vulgar word come out. I hear Christians sometimes on Facebook, cussing. And then the next minute they're praising God. And thanking God and how God has been good to them. You are a Christian, you are a believer, and you can tolerate that kind of nonsense coming out of your mouth. Why? You haven't meditate enough to see yourself as who you are in Christ. You got religion, that's it. You said basically what you're doing. I see Jesus driving out there. The money changes. I see Jesus driving out the money changes out of the temple. And man, right now I see it so I am. Something driving the money changes. The truth is love has to rebuke sometimes. I hear me rebuke in love, but really, there's just too much nonsense that we do it. And we call ourselves Christians. That is no different from other world does. And the only reason we're okay with that is we're not spending enough time meditating in Scripture. We got religion. But it would really, really have a relationship with Jesus. And we really, really was meditating upon this word. And see who he is and see what he thinks about sin. If we were replacing our thoughts about sin with his thoughts. If we were replacing our thoughts about the world with his thoughts, the things we would not tolerate. You don't need a rule. You just won't want to do it. And when you do it, you will feel so out of place. Oh God, hurry up. Internalize the word. Talk with God. Let's turn the truth or the meditation into prayer. Talk with God. Make that word a prayer. The Lord is my Lord. Wow. I thank you all for being my shepherd. From me to have you as a shepherd. What have I done to deserve it? To have you watching about me protecting me and guiding me? Thank you, Lord. Lord, you are my shepherd. And the Scripture says, I shall not want it. So Lord, I just want you to know. Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for wisdom today. Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for peace in this crisis. Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for sleep. I will sleep in Jesus' name. What are you doing? You take the word of the truth and you turn it into prayer. You make it the basis of a conversation with God. And as you are doing that, that word is getting on the inside of you more and more and more. Now your meditation has a magic prayer. And it's not just empty words. It's prayer that is filled with faith. Because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word. As you have meditated upon the word faith as a reason you turn that knowledge of prayer. And the Lord hears the prayers of the righteous man. All right? So let's rush through the other pieces. A is what? To apply the truth. So now you got to say you meditated on the truth. You heard what Bishop said today. Now you can't say you got to apply it. You got to say now what am I supposed to do today? Because of this truth. Say this. This is application. What should I know? Say no. What should I believe? What should I do? And when you look at Psalm 231, what should I know? What should I now believe? What lies should I stop believing because of this truth? What should I do as a result of what I just learned? You hear me? Because you want to apply the words. You want to put it into practice. And when you start putting the word into practice, that's when the power transformation kicks in. And you begin to see yourself changing in ways that you didn't realize. I'm not saying there's no battle. But you keep pressing in, and the word will eventually prevail. T. Think on it what? So yeah, deep meditation requires that you are alone and you're focused, but you can't be in the closet all day. And you're in the closet all day, I will rebuke you. Because the word says the man does not work, he should not. So God knows there are times that you must be in the closet alone, but there are times you need to be at work. And there are times you need to be in church. I hear me, there's work to be done in the kingdom. All right, so by hear me, thank God, you can take the word with you. You won't be able to engage in deep meditation, but wherever you go, quietly, you can be meditating. You can be muttering this word all the time. Use your mouth and keep uttering the word. Don't listen to music all day. Mutter, mutter, much of the word. Don't leave the breakfast you had with God if you meditate in the morning. Don't leave that on the breakfast table and go. Take it with you. Think on it. Whatever is true, whatever is no but et cetera. Think on it. You make a decision throughout the day. You're going to be muttering that truth. Today, tomorrow, the next day, keep rolling it in your mind, keep muttering it under your lips, and when you can't keep voicing it aloud. Lastly, say to your neighbor, enjoy the Lord. Enjoy the word is sweet. David said, oh, how I love your law. It should be my meditations all the day long. Enjoy the word. Enjoy the grace of God. Enjoy the love of God. Enjoy the friendship of the Holy Spirit and expect fruit, much fruit, to be the result of your meditation. Because this is what the Lord says in Psalm chapter 2. I'll close with this. Blessed is that man who walks not. Walks right? Walks right in the counsel of the Lord stands in the way of the sinner. Lord sits in the seat of the but here's the light. Here's what. Here's the light. It's not a duty. Here's the light. Say that here's the light. It's in the law. We say in the word of the law. And in his word, does he do what? Meditate day and night. And he shall be like what? A tree planted by the rivers of water that will bring forth his fruit in his season. His leaves shall never wither. And whatsoever he does, shall prosper. Say hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. We who meditate are like the tree. Plant it. That means nothing moves us. Bad news doesn't move me. Good news. Maybe moves me a little. But my moving is not what he based upon my circumstance. I move by the goodness of God. I move by the grace of God. I move by the faithfulness of God. And that is constant. That doesn't change. When things become bad, God is still good. When things are good, God is still gooder. Say hallelujah. So when my delight is in the Lord, then really my circumstances don't really move me. I don't get happy because something happened because I'm already happened because Jesus happened. Amen. Now, here's the call to action. Do something today about what you've heard. Start meditating today. You can take the meal. I just fetch provided for you the meditate on or you can cook your own. But you start today. You don't need a long verse. You don't need a lot of verses. Start with one verse. Start with one truth. But begin to meditate today. And ask the Holy Spirit to cause you to increase your meditation. Because you see the more you meditate, the more you soak your mind in the word of God, the more it transforms your life. And it makes you like God. Did you hear that? A man who thinks like God will start to act like God, will start to talk like God, will start to walk in success like God. That is your portion. That's my portion in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, if you're going to be a do of this word, I want you to stand. If all of these do us, if all of these who are committing to doing the word, actually go ahead and do the word, we have a new church. This church has to come brand new. You hear me? Father, I pray that you see each person, each person, each man, each woman who is standing up, you see their heart. And the decision that they have made concerning meditation, that they will be like the sound one man, who will meditate in your word continually. And I thank you that because they will meditate in your word, they will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. They will be stable and unmovable. They will be fruitful in the name of Jesus. They will bear fruit for your glory. In the name of Jesus, regardless of the changes around them, they will remain the same steadfast and fruitful because they are planted by the rivers of water. And through meditation, they are receiving that water that gives them life and strength and wisdom. Thank you, O God. Holy Spirit, keep this message on their minds. Keep reminding them until they take action. I pray that this word will not be stolen in the name of Jesus. Let this word be received and let it be approved in each of us. In Jesus name, I pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.

**[00:20 - 00:21]** Meditation.

**[00:21 - 00:22]** Amen?

**[00:22 - 00:23]** How many of you were here?

**[00:25 - 00:27]** Okay, it looks like, come on, raise your hand.

**[00:27 - 00:29]** I'm going to get a sense of how many were here.

**[00:29 - 00:31]** Look, like 50% of you.

**[00:31 - 00:34]** The other 50% you were not here,

**[00:34 - 00:37]** and I hope you had a good reason for not being here.

**[00:37 - 00:40]** Other than you just didn't want to get out of bed.

**[00:40 - 00:43]** Okay, because some days of Lord's Day

**[00:43 - 00:47]** and we ought to gather together to worship and amen.

**[00:49 - 00:50]** you were not here.

**[00:50 - 00:53]** Thank God for technology.

**[00:58 - 01:00]** And if you haven't subscribed to our channel,

**[01:00 - 01:02]** to my channel, to the churches YouTube channel,

**[01:02 - 01:04]** encourage you to do that

**[01:04 - 01:06]** because you can listen to these sermons

**[01:06 - 01:08]** over and over again, all right?

**[01:08 - 01:11]** But do that and go and listen to it

**[01:11 - 01:16]** because it is critical for your well-being, all right?

**[01:16 - 01:20]** We spoke to you last Sunday on the subject of what?

**[01:20 - 01:22]** Meditation.

**[01:22 - 01:25]** In our text on that Sunday, the foundation text was what?

**[01:25 - 01:30]** John chapter one, verse eight.

**[01:30 - 01:31]** And this is what we read.

**[01:31 - 01:35]** This book of the law shall not do what?

**[01:35 - 01:37]** Joshua, excuse me.

**[01:37 - 01:41]** This book, you say I was testing you, I need you.

**[01:41 - 01:44]** You guys are listening, you're meditating, amen?

**[01:44 - 01:49]** This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth,

**[01:49 - 01:54]** but you shall meditate in it day and night

**[01:55 - 01:57]** that you may observe to do according to all

**[01:57 - 01:59]** that is written therein

**[01:59 - 02:01]** and then you will make your way

**[02:01 - 02:05]** prosperous and you'll have good success, amen?

**[02:05 - 02:09]** That passage focuses on the importance

**[02:09 - 02:14]** and the priority that you and I should give to meditation.

**[02:15 - 02:16]** Are you listening to me?

**[02:19 - 02:23]** The Lord was instructing Joshua

**[02:23 - 02:27]** on how to successfully fulfill his assignment

**[02:27 - 02:31]** because Joshua had just received

**[02:31 - 02:34]** this huge responsibility from God

**[02:34 - 02:39]** that was to replace Moses as the leader of Israel

**[02:40 - 02:45]** and to take Israel into the Promised Land

**[02:45 - 02:48]** facing all of the giants, the Kirinized Jericho.

**[02:48 - 02:50]** That was a tough assignment,

**[02:50 - 02:53]** but that was God's will for Joshua.

**[02:53 - 02:58]** And God says to Joshua, knowing what Joshua was about to do

**[02:58 - 03:00]** and the battles that he was going to fight,

**[03:00 - 03:04]** God says to Joshua, Joshua, this is what you need to do

**[03:04 - 03:07]** to be successful and prosperous in carrying out my assignment.

**[03:07 - 03:11]** If you want to carry out my assignment successfully

**[03:11 - 03:15]** and fulfill that assignment, this is what's going to be required.

**[03:15 - 03:19]** He didn't say Joshua, you need to master the art of warfare.

**[03:21 - 03:23]** Joshua, you need to learn and train your people

**[03:23 - 03:25]** how to use the sword.

**[03:25 - 03:27]** Now, those things have their place

**[03:27 - 03:30]** but that was not where God placed the emphasis.

**[03:30 - 03:33]** God said, Joshua, here's a secret.

**[03:33 - 03:36]** Here's the thing that if you do this, I guarantee you

**[03:36 - 03:38]** you will fulfill your assignment.

**[03:38 - 03:41]** You will carry out my will.

**[03:41 - 03:43]** You will be successful in carrying out my will.

**[03:43 - 03:46]** You will prosper in carrying out my will.

**[03:46 - 03:50]** Whatever the assignment I had given you, Joshua,

**[03:50 - 03:53]** this is the secret to accomplishing it.

**[03:53 - 03:59]** Take my word and meditate on it day and night.

**[03:59 - 04:02]** Not just look at it, not just read it.

**[04:02 - 04:07]** Meditate on it and meditate on it day and night.

**[04:07 - 04:10]** In other words, make it your habit,

**[04:10 - 04:13]** make it your practice on a daily basis

**[04:13 - 04:16]** as often as you can throughout the day.

**[04:16 - 04:20]** Make it your practice, Joshua,

**[04:20 - 04:22]** to meditate on my word.

**[04:22 - 04:25]** And if you will do this, Joshua,

**[04:25 - 04:27]** you, by that decision,

**[04:27 - 04:30]** will ensure that you will prosper

**[04:30 - 04:35]** and experience good success in doing my will, okay?

**[04:35 - 04:36]** I know many times we'll read that

**[04:36 - 04:37]** and it was your prosperous success.

**[04:37 - 04:39]** It means if I do this, I'm gonna have a mansion.

**[04:39 - 04:41]** I'm gonna drive Mercedes-Benz.

**[04:41 - 04:42]** I'm gonna become a millionaire.

**[04:42 - 04:45]** That's not what God was saying to Joshua.

**[04:45 - 04:46]** Well, God was saying to Joshua,

**[04:46 - 04:49]** if you do this, you will be successful in prosperous,

**[04:49 - 04:52]** incurring out and fulfilling my assignment for your life,

**[04:52 - 04:53]** my heavenly assignment.

**[04:53 - 04:55]** Isn't that what you want?

**[04:55 - 04:58]** Watch your man profit he gains the whole world

**[04:58 - 04:59]** and loses his soul.

**[04:59 - 05:01]** What does a man profit he gains the whole world

**[05:01 - 05:05]** and doesn't fulfill the assignment that God gave him?

**[05:05 - 05:06]** You and I should be living every day

**[05:06 - 05:07]** to fulfill that assignment.

**[05:09 - 05:11]** Amen, and the man who fulfills that assignment

**[05:11 - 05:12]** is truly prosperous.

**[05:12 - 05:16]** The man who fulfills that assignment is truly blessed.

**[05:16 - 05:19]** The man who fulfills that assignment is truly prosperous.

**[05:19 - 05:22]** Don't measure success and prosperity by your bank account

**[05:23 - 05:26]** or by the size of your house.

**[05:26 - 05:27]** Do you hear me?

**[05:27 - 05:29]** Amen, God blesses us with things to enjoy,

**[05:29 - 05:32]** richly with things to enjoy.

**[05:32 - 05:34]** That is the fringe benefit.

**[05:34 - 05:36]** That is not the core.

**[05:36 - 05:41]** Amen, the most important thing you can do with your life

**[05:42 - 05:44]** and the reason you're on earth for how long God

**[05:44 - 05:46]** will allow you to be on earth

**[05:46 - 05:49]** is to accomplish a particular assignment for His glory.

**[05:51 - 05:54]** I hear me and the way you accomplish that,

**[05:54 - 05:58]** they think that you must not miss

**[05:58 - 06:03]** is that meditating on the Word of God is essential.

**[06:03 - 06:04]** So say to your neighbor,

**[06:06 - 06:08]** I'm going to meditate on God's work.

**[06:09 - 06:12]** Day and night.

**[06:12 - 06:15]** Amen, so let me repeat.

**[06:15 - 06:18]** Meditation is God's chosen method

**[06:18 - 06:21]** for transforming our hearts and minds

**[06:21 - 06:26]** and causing us to experience good success

**[06:26 - 06:31]** in carrying out His divine will and assignments daily.

**[06:32 - 06:34]** You know, if you're married, you have an assignment

**[06:35 - 06:37]** concerning your spouse.

**[06:37 - 06:43]** Meditation will empower you to fulfill that assignment daily.

**[06:43 - 06:45]** If you are an employer and employee,

**[06:45 - 06:50]** you have an assignment there to represent and reflect Christ.

**[06:50 - 06:55]** In all you do, meditating will empower you

**[06:55 - 06:57]** to fulfill that assignment there.

**[06:58 - 07:02]** In every area God has an assignment

**[07:02 - 07:05]** and you want to fulfill that assignment on a daily basis

**[07:05 - 07:10]** and the key to that is to make meditating on God's Word

**[07:11 - 07:12]** essential, right?

**[07:12 - 07:15]** And when we talk about meditating on God's Word,

**[07:15 - 07:17]** again, we're distinguishing it from reading.

**[07:17 - 07:20]** Reading has this place.

**[07:20 - 07:22]** Reading will give you information

**[07:23 - 07:25]** but meditation will produce what?

**[07:25 - 07:26]** Transformation.

**[07:26 - 07:31]** Say reading God's Word gives me knowledge or information.

**[07:32 - 07:36]** Meditating transforms me.

**[07:38 - 07:41]** Reading information, meditation, transformation

**[07:41 - 07:45]** and what God is looking for is to transform you

**[07:46 - 07:51]** into the image of Jesus, Hallelujah.

**[07:52 - 07:56]** So if you have to choose only one of the spiritual disciplines

**[07:56 - 08:00]** to focus on, if you had to choose between meditation

**[08:00 - 08:04]** and prayer and worship,

**[08:04 - 08:07]** I said to you last week, choose meditation.

**[08:09 - 08:11]** Because again, God didn't say to Joshua,

**[08:11 - 08:12]** if you want to prosper here,

**[08:12 - 08:14]** I want you to pray day and night.

**[08:14 - 08:16]** I want you to worship day and night.

**[08:16 - 08:20]** Now, we know prayer and worship, very important,

**[08:20 - 08:22]** but that's not my God's Word Joshua.

**[08:22 - 08:26]** God said Joshua, I want you to meditate on my Word day and night.

**[08:26 - 08:30]** Now ask yourself, how much are you meditating on God's Word?

**[08:31 - 08:34]** Do you think if you were Joshua, God would have told you

**[08:34 - 08:35]** anything differently?

**[08:36 - 08:39]** I don't think so, he would have told you the same thing.

**[08:39 - 08:42]** And today, when we come to him with our challenges

**[08:42 - 08:46]** in our marriages, as spouses, as parents of children,

**[08:46 - 08:49]** as business people, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

**[08:49 - 08:53]** if you were to come to God and ask God for his best advice,

**[08:54 - 08:58]** though nothing God says should be treated simply as advice,

**[08:58 - 09:00]** but if you ask God, God, what should I do?

**[09:00 - 09:05]** I guarantee you God will first of all reinforce to you

**[09:08 - 09:13]** how important it is for you to meditate in his Word day and night.

**[09:14 - 09:19]** Question, church, are you meditating day and night on God's Word?

**[09:22 - 09:27]** And if you're not, it explains why you're not being transformed.

**[09:29 - 09:32]** It explains why you're not experiencing good success

**[09:32 - 09:33]** in that area.

**[09:33 - 09:37]** It explains why you keep struggling and struggling struggling

**[09:37 - 09:40]** because you're trying to change in your own strength.

**[09:40 - 09:42]** You're trying to win the battle, so you're fighting

**[09:42 - 09:44]** in your own mind.

**[09:44 - 09:46]** And God said, you know what?

**[09:46 - 09:49]** You go ahead and start meditating upon my Word.

**[09:49 - 09:51]** What happens when you meditate on God's Word

**[09:51 - 09:53]** is that the Word of God transforms you.

**[09:53 - 09:58]** And on the inside, and that is what you want to happen.

**[10:02 - 10:03]** And that is what God wants to happen.

**[10:03 - 10:07]** God wants your change to be from the inside out.

**[10:10 - 10:14]** And it is the Word of God when meditating upon day and night

**[10:14 - 10:17]** that will transform you on the inside.

**[10:17 - 10:22]** It'll transform the way you think and then the way you believe

**[10:22 - 10:26]** and then the way you feel and then the way you behave.

**[10:27 - 10:32]** Because when you get changed, when your thoughts in the heart

**[10:33 - 10:38]** are changed, the emotions are changed.

**[10:38 - 10:43]** Because our emotions are tied to our thinking.

**[10:43 - 10:46]** We still here, you're tracking your following, right?

**[10:46 - 10:49]** Our emotions are tied to our thinking.

**[10:49 - 10:50]** And then when our emotions get changed,

**[10:50 - 10:53]** our behavior follows because emotions have a lot to do

**[10:53 - 10:54]** with the way you behave.

**[10:56 - 10:58]** The reason you talk to me badly,

**[10:58 - 11:03]** or I talk to you badly is because you heard my feelings.

**[11:03 - 11:06]** My feelings provoke my angry response.

**[11:07 - 11:08]** I hear me.

**[11:09 - 11:13]** So, since I want to change my behavior

**[11:13 - 11:16]** because my behavior will change the results I get in life,

**[11:16 - 11:18]** I gotta go backward, okay?

**[11:18 - 11:19]** Results are the result of behavior.

**[11:19 - 11:24]** Behavior is largely influenced by emotions and emotions.

**[11:24 - 11:26]** I influenced my thoughts.

**[11:26 - 11:29]** I need to change my thoughts.

**[11:29 - 11:36]** So that eventually my behavior changes.

**[11:36 - 11:37]** All right, we can do, come on.

**[11:37 - 11:44]** Everyone of you should be clapping now, amen?

**[11:44 - 11:48]** So you prioritize meditation

**[11:48 - 11:52]** because of the impact and meditation has upon us

**[11:52 - 11:55]** in changing us and transforming us.

**[11:56 - 11:58]** Hallelujah, and we wanna do it day and night.

**[11:58 - 12:02]** It needs to become a habit, all right?

**[12:02 - 12:07]** So again, God places a huge, a huge power to our meditation.

**[12:07 - 12:09]** Even before prayer, even before worship,

**[12:09 - 12:13]** because meditation is in fact prayer

**[12:13 - 12:16]** and meditation is in fact worship.

**[12:16 - 12:19]** And true meditation actually sets other prayers

**[12:19 - 12:23]** and other forms of worship on fire.

**[12:23 - 12:25]** If you just worship without meditating,

**[12:25 - 12:29]** I told you last week you're worshiping without revelation.

**[12:29 - 12:30]** And if you're worshiping without revelation,

**[12:30 - 12:35]** it's just empty words.

**[12:35 - 12:38]** Try meditating upon God's goodness and greatness

**[12:38 - 12:40]** and then worship.

**[12:40 - 12:44]** And you will see how it adds fuel and fire to your worship.

**[12:45 - 12:46]** Amen?

**[12:46 - 12:48]** Try meditating on God's word

**[12:48 - 12:51]** and God's goodness, God's love, God's grace, God's promises.

**[12:51 - 12:55]** And then pray and you will see how meditating

**[12:56 - 13:04]** ignites your prayer and sets it on fire, amen?

**[13:04 - 13:07]** So one more time, let's repeat this book of the law.

**[13:08 - 13:11]** Now for us, book of the law really for us

**[13:11 - 13:13]** is the word of grace.

**[13:13 - 13:15]** Paul said, I commit you to God

**[13:15 - 13:20]** and to the word of his grace

**[13:20 - 13:25]** which will build you up and give you your heritists.

**[13:25 - 13:26]** Let's repeat that.

**[13:26 - 13:31]** I commit you or commend you to God

**[13:32 - 13:37]** and the word of his grace

**[13:37 - 13:39]** which will do what?

**[13:39 - 13:41]** Build you up and do what?

**[13:41 - 13:45]** Give you your inheritance is waiting for you

**[13:45 - 13:48]** but God says the way you're gonna receive that inheritance

**[13:48 - 13:50]** is by means of the word of his grace.

**[13:50 - 13:53]** So when Paul said I commend you to God

**[13:53 - 13:56]** and the word of his grace, he's saying meditate on

**[13:56 - 13:58]** the word of his grace

**[13:58 - 14:01]** because by meditating on the word of his grace

**[14:01 - 14:04]** it will build you up.

**[14:04 - 14:06]** One of the things that will build is your faith.

**[14:06 - 14:09]** It will build your hope.

**[14:09 - 14:11]** It will build your love.

**[14:11 - 14:12]** How you hear me?

**[14:12 - 14:15]** It will build you up and do what?

**[14:15 - 14:18]** Deliver your inheritance to you

**[14:18 - 14:21]** which means without meditating on God's grace

**[14:21 - 14:26]** don't expect to walk in your inheritance.

**[14:28 - 14:31]** Said it only about I have inheritance

**[14:32 - 14:36]** that I'm gonna walk on, walking this, excuse me.

**[14:36 - 14:38]** Peace is my inheritance.

**[14:39 - 14:42]** Joy is my inheritance.

**[14:42 - 14:44]** I hear me, patience.

**[14:45 - 14:47]** You don't have to always be losing your temper

**[14:47 - 14:49]** so I was born in September.

**[14:49 - 14:54]** Hey man, hey man, your inheritance is peace.

**[14:54 - 14:56]** You don't have to get angry and upset

**[14:56 - 14:59]** and then you create stresses in your body

**[14:59 - 15:02]** that causes your blood pressure to go up.

**[15:02 - 15:04]** Hey man, you get angry, you're not forgiving,

**[15:04 - 15:06]** you create stresses in your body

**[15:06 - 15:08]** that causes you to constrict

**[15:08 - 15:11]** and then you develop arthritis and all kinds of stuff.

**[15:11 - 15:13]** I'm not saying everybody who got arthritis years.

**[15:17 - 15:21]** But your emotions do affect your body.

**[15:21 - 15:24]** They call it psychosomatic diseases, right?

**[15:24 - 15:27]** And man, there are diseases that develop on a body

**[15:27 - 15:38]** that can be traced directly to our thinking.

**[15:38 - 15:48]** All right, God tells Joshua to perfect the art of meditation

**[15:48 - 15:51]** and to do it day and night.

**[15:51 - 15:54]** Because what happens in your mind

**[15:55 - 16:00]** determines or influences what happens in your life.

**[16:02 - 16:04]** It's not the soul determinant,

**[16:04 - 16:08]** there's some things that you don't control.

**[16:08 - 16:10]** But what happens in your mind

**[16:10 - 16:12]** is gonna impact your behaviors

**[16:12 - 16:15]** and your behavior will determine

**[16:15 - 16:19]** and impact what you experience in life.

**[16:19 - 16:22]** That's just a reality.

**[16:22 - 16:25]** Trouble would come, Jesus says they will.

**[16:25 - 16:27]** How you respond to that trouble

**[16:27 - 16:35]** will determine the results ultimately that you obtain.

**[16:35 - 16:41]** So trouble can cause you to become crazy.

**[16:41 - 16:44]** A trouble can eventually produce a joy

**[16:44 - 16:45]** and a peace in your heart

**[16:45 - 16:52]** that passeth all understanding.

**[16:52 - 16:53]** So here I mean guys,

**[16:54 - 16:57]** let's not be here as of the word only.

**[16:57 - 16:59]** Let's be what?

**[16:59 - 17:01]** And what is the word that we're gonna do?

**[17:01 - 17:05]** We're gonna start meditating in God's word.

**[17:05 - 17:06]** How often?

**[17:07 - 17:11]** That means all the time.

**[17:11 - 17:15]** Never stop meditating, meditate all the time.

**[17:15 - 17:18]** Now what is biblical meditation?

**[17:18 - 17:23]** It is that spirit-led practice of focusing

**[17:23 - 17:28]** your mind or your thoughts on God

**[17:29 - 17:33]** or on God's word or God's truth

**[17:34 - 17:37]** to focus your mind and your thoughts

**[17:37 - 17:42]** on God's word, God's truth, God's revelation.

**[17:44 - 17:48]** In a sustained manner,

**[17:48 - 17:53]** until it transforms the way you think,

**[17:53 - 17:56]** the way you believe and the way you behave.

**[17:58 - 18:03]** The goal of this meditation is to exchange

**[18:03 - 18:06]** your thoughts for God's.

**[18:07 - 18:09]** What is the goal?

**[18:09 - 18:13]** To exchange your thoughts for God's.

**[18:13 - 18:16]** Because He says my ways are not one of your ways.

**[18:16 - 18:19]** My thoughts are not your thoughts.

**[18:19 - 18:20]** You see, we get born again

**[18:20 - 18:25]** and we got all kinds of thoughts and attitudes

**[18:25 - 18:27]** that we brought with us.

**[18:27 - 18:30]** And when you are born again, the Bible says

**[18:30 - 18:33]** you become a new creature.

**[18:34 - 18:37]** All things are what pass the way

**[18:37 - 18:39]** and all things become new.

**[18:39 - 18:41]** But this refers to your spirit.

**[18:42 - 18:45]** Your spirit becomes brand new.

**[18:45 - 18:49]** But you know, not everything changes

**[18:50 - 18:52]** when you get saved.

**[18:52 - 18:54]** If you had a big nose, you still have one.

**[18:55 - 18:58]** If you had a big lips, you still have one.

**[18:58 - 19:03]** If you had whatever, if you had too much, whatever,

**[19:03 - 19:04]** you still got too much.

**[19:04 - 19:06]** If you have enough, you still got enough.

**[19:06 - 19:09]** In other words, physically nothing changes.

**[19:09 - 19:12]** Immediately, right?

**[19:12 - 19:14]** But there's a brand new change

**[19:14 - 19:17]** that takes place in your spirit.

**[19:17 - 19:20]** You become literally brand new.

**[19:20 - 19:22]** You actually in your spirit

**[19:22 - 19:24]** start to partake of the nature of Jesus.

**[19:25 - 19:27]** Say hallelujah.

**[19:27 - 19:28]** The scripture says,

**[19:28 - 19:31]** as he is so are you in your spirit.

**[19:31 - 19:33]** But you know that two other parts of you.

**[19:33 - 19:37]** One is your soul, that is your mind, your will

**[19:37 - 19:38]** and your emotions.

**[19:38 - 19:40]** Are you still here?

**[19:40 - 19:42]** And then the other is your body, right?

**[19:42 - 19:45]** So your spirit has changed now

**[19:45 - 19:48]** because you want to be conformed to the image of Jesus.

**[19:48 - 19:51]** You gotta start exchanging your thoughts

**[19:51 - 19:56]** which are not instantly different or transformed.

**[19:56 - 20:00]** You now want to exchange those thoughts that you have

**[20:01 - 20:02]** for the thoughts of God.

**[20:04 - 20:07]** You say, why is it important that I exchange my thoughts

**[20:07 - 20:08]** for the thoughts of God?

**[20:08 - 20:10]** Because scripture says in the book of Proverbs,

**[20:10 - 20:13]** I think it's chapter 23 for seven.

**[20:13 - 20:18]** As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.

**[20:20 - 20:25]** Why do I want to exchange my thoughts for God?

**[20:25 - 20:27]** Because of the power of thoughts.

**[20:27 - 20:31]** As a man thinketh in his heart.

**[20:31 - 20:35]** So he is, in other words, the way the brain is trained

**[20:35 - 20:39]** to think is gonna affect the way you behave.

**[20:39 - 20:44]** I told you last week that the brain is like a thermostat.

**[20:44 - 20:46]** If you set the thermostat on 75 degrees,

**[20:46 - 20:50]** the temperature in the room will become 75 degrees.

**[20:50 - 20:53]** If the thermostat in your brain is set

**[20:53 - 20:56]** odd feelings of abandonments,

**[20:56 - 21:00]** you will experience feelings of abandonment.

**[21:00 - 21:05]** If the thermostat in your brain is set on worry,

**[21:05 - 21:07]** you will experience worry.

**[21:07 - 21:09]** If you set on fear, you will experience fear.

**[21:09 - 21:13]** So you want to exchange your thoughts for God

**[21:13 - 21:16]** because if you exchange your thoughts for God

**[21:16 - 21:21]** and the thermostat in your brain is set on God.

**[21:21 - 21:22]** It's set on the promises of God.

**[21:22 - 21:24]** It's set on the character of God.

**[21:24 - 21:26]** It's set on the purposes of God.

**[21:26 - 21:27]** It's set on the goodness of God.

**[21:27 - 21:29]** It's set on the faithfulness of God.

**[21:29 - 21:31]** It's set on the presence of God.

**[21:31 - 21:32]** It's set on the plan of God.

**[21:32 - 21:33]** Are you hearing me?

**[21:33 - 21:35]** It's set on God.

**[21:35 - 21:37]** And when your brain thermostat is set on God,

**[21:37 - 21:43]** it affects your feelings and affects your behavior.

**[21:43 - 21:47]** Listen to me, thoughts are extremely powerful.

**[21:47 - 21:50]** Thoughts can change your behavior,

**[21:50 - 21:52]** can change your emotions,

**[21:52 - 21:56]** can change your life for good or for bad,

**[21:56 - 21:59]** depending upon what you choose to focus your thoughts on.

**[22:01 - 22:04]** Hear me, how many of you have observed recently

**[22:04 - 22:07]** that seems to be a tremendous increase

**[22:07 - 22:10]** in people claiming to be lesbians and homosexuals?

**[22:12 - 22:16]** Oh, you don't want to raise your hand?

**[22:16 - 22:17]** I mean, it's strange.

**[22:17 - 22:18]** So what are men, all of a sudden,

**[22:18 - 22:19]** everybody coming out?

**[22:21 - 22:23]** Where were these people before?

**[22:23 - 22:25]** Were they all undercover?

**[22:25 - 22:28]** Or are there actually more people,

**[22:28 - 22:31]** more men now being attracted to men than before,

**[22:31 - 22:34]** more women being attracted to women than before?

**[22:35 - 22:37]** More people want to change who they are sexually,

**[22:37 - 22:39]** want to start dressing like men

**[22:39 - 22:41]** even though they're biological women.

**[22:42 - 22:44]** Where is this coming from?

**[22:45 - 22:47]** Is it true that all of them were,

**[22:47 - 22:53]** that they were born this way?

**[22:53 - 22:54]** You know, I heard something just last week

**[22:54 - 22:56]** because I was asking myself that,

**[22:56 - 22:58]** what's happening?

**[22:59 - 23:01]** And I really believe the Lord opened my eyes

**[23:01 - 23:04]** to see if this is on the only course,

**[23:04 - 23:07]** but suddenly I think this is the major course

**[23:07 - 23:08]** for all of a sudden, what's happening?

**[23:10 - 23:15]** Is, you know what, your brain can be wired and rewired.

**[23:19 - 23:22]** Let me share, you know, there was a lady

**[23:22 - 23:25]** who shared her story a little years ago.

**[23:25 - 23:30]** She realized that from Friday to Sunday,

**[23:32 - 23:33]** she would be very happy.

**[23:35 - 23:38]** But as soon as Monday comes, weekdays

**[23:38 - 23:40]** from Monday to Thursday, she'll be depressed.

**[23:40 - 23:42]** Sad.

**[23:42 - 23:43]** Then the weekend will come

**[23:43 - 23:46]** and it seems that all the burdens are gone

**[23:46 - 23:47]** as she's happy.

**[23:47 - 23:50]** Then Monday shows up and from Monday to Thursday,

**[23:50 - 23:51]** she's sad.

**[23:52 - 23:55]** And she didn't know what was happening.

**[23:55 - 23:56]** She was a Christian.

**[23:56 - 24:01]** And the Lord opened her eyes to see why this was the case.

**[24:02 - 24:04]** Growing up as a child,

**[24:06 - 24:08]** her father was always away

**[24:09 - 24:11]** from Monday to Thursday.

**[24:12 - 24:13]** He wasn't at home.

**[24:14 - 24:18]** As a Monday to Thursday, she was at home with her dad

**[24:19 - 24:23]** who missed her father and began to feel a sense

**[24:23 - 24:26]** of loneliness and eating abandonment

**[24:27 - 24:30]** because dad was never there Monday to Thursday,

**[24:30 - 24:32]** but Friday, dad came home.

**[24:34 - 24:38]** And so from Friday to Sunday, dad was there.

**[24:38 - 24:39]** She wasn't feeling abandoned.

**[24:39 - 24:42]** She felt secure her dad was there.

**[24:42 - 24:46]** But Monday, dad has to go and once again,

**[24:46 - 24:49]** when dad leaves the sense of being alone,

**[24:49 - 24:51]** sense of being abandoned,

**[24:51 - 24:54]** she would experience that, leading her to being sad.

**[24:54 - 24:56]** And over a course of time,

**[24:56 - 25:02]** you keep repeating that the brain gets wired

**[25:02 - 25:07]** to connect Monday to Wednesday to Thursday Friday

**[25:08 - 25:15]** with feelings or a sense of abandonment.

**[25:15 - 25:17]** So now, even though she's an adult

**[25:19 - 25:21]** and the circumstances have changed,

**[25:23 - 25:26]** every Monday, their brain has been wired

**[25:27 - 25:31]** to connect Monday to Wednesday, Thursday and Friday

**[25:35 - 25:37]** to abandonment.

**[25:38 - 25:41]** And because the brain has connected

**[25:41 - 25:42]** those days to abandonment,

**[25:42 - 25:47]** the feelings associated with abandonment is sadness.

**[25:47 - 25:57]** But it comes and the brain has connected Friday

**[25:57 - 25:59]** with dad's presence.

**[25:59 - 26:01]** And so even though circumstances physically have changed,

**[26:01 - 26:03]** the brain is still wired.

**[26:04 - 26:07]** That explains why some of us,

**[26:07 - 26:11]** when we hear about an airplane going to fly,

**[26:11 - 26:12]** we get afraid.

**[26:14 - 26:16]** On certain words, somebody speaks that word

**[26:16 - 26:20]** and we find ourselves overreacting,

**[26:20 - 26:23]** because in our brain, whatever just happened

**[26:23 - 26:25]** is connected to something bad.

**[26:26 - 26:35]** For which you feel you need to protect yourself.

**[26:35 - 26:37]** Your thoughts are powerful.

**[26:37 - 26:42]** And the brain is wired by your experiences

**[26:43 - 26:45]** and by the things you continue to focus on

**[26:45 - 26:48]** in such a way that certain things

**[26:48 - 26:53]** would trigger certain actions.

**[26:53 - 26:55]** And here's the good news and we'll talk about that.

**[26:55 - 26:56]** Your brain can be rewired.

**[26:58 - 27:03]** So your brain, say, my brain can be rewired.

**[27:04 - 27:08]** One more time, my brain can be rewired.

**[27:08 - 27:11]** That is what is called renewing your mind

**[27:11 - 27:13]** in Romans chapter 12.

**[27:13 - 27:17]** I be seated there for bread and by the mercess of God

**[27:17 - 27:18]** to be what?

**[27:18 - 27:23]** Transformed by the no longer be conformed to this world.

**[27:25 - 27:30]** This, the brain has been wired over time to think

**[27:32 - 27:34]** and respond to problems and challenges

**[27:34 - 27:38]** and things in your environment like the world changes

**[27:38 - 27:40]** or the world responds.

**[27:40 - 27:44]** And for us to listen, you can now rewire your brain.

**[27:44 - 27:47]** It's called renewing your mind.

**[27:47 - 27:52]** And he says, this is the method, this is the process.

**[27:52 - 27:57]** This is what you do to renew a rewire the brain

**[27:57 - 28:00]** meditate on my word.

**[28:00 - 28:04]** So if there's any stuff happening in your brain

**[28:04 - 28:08]** that causes you to not be walking in the peace of God

**[28:08 - 28:11]** or the joy of the Lord, of the victory of Christ,

**[28:11 - 28:14]** you need to understand that because it's something

**[28:14 - 28:17]** in your brain has been wired a certain way,

**[28:17 - 28:19]** but here's a good news for the help of the Holy Spirit

**[28:19 - 28:21]** and the decision of your will.

**[28:21 - 28:24]** You can begin to rewire your brain

**[28:24 - 28:27]** so that those things that once triggered negative emotions

**[28:27 - 28:30]** lose their power because now those experiences

**[28:30 - 28:34]** are connected to God and not to your past.

**[28:35 - 28:37]** I'm preaching better than you're listening.

**[28:38 - 28:40]** I'm helping you more than you're admitting.

**[28:42 - 28:44]** Come and raise your hands and thank you Jesus.

**[28:44 - 28:45]** Continue to teach us.

**[28:45 - 28:48]** So what's happening in the homosexual peace?

**[28:48 - 28:49]** Why is it all, I mean,

**[28:49 - 28:53]** everywhere you turn, it looks like they're everywhere.

**[28:53 - 28:55]** That sounded kind of bad, but,

**[28:56 - 28:59]** but yes, you know, and I don't want to sound bad.

**[28:59 - 29:03]** I just want to share what I think is happening.

**[29:05 - 29:07]** I believe one of the reasons,

**[29:07 - 29:10]** I'm saying the major reason for all of these folks

**[29:10 - 29:14]** showing up as the eye, young ladies who grew up normally

**[29:14 - 29:16]** and the next time, before you know it,

**[29:16 - 29:19]** they say they're lesbian, young boys that grew up

**[29:19 - 29:23]** and before you know it, they say they're homosexuals and trap.

**[29:23 - 29:24]** What's happening?

**[29:24 - 29:27]** I believe it's due to the power of meditation.

**[29:28 - 29:32]** I believe their brains are being rewired.

**[29:34 - 29:35]** By what?

**[29:35 - 29:39]** Pornography.

**[29:39 - 29:42]** You see, there was a time when you know

**[29:42 - 29:46]** what we were growing up, you didn't have pornography everywhere.

**[29:46 - 29:48]** And when you did see anybody,

**[29:48 - 29:53]** it was usually between a man and a woman.

**[29:53 - 29:57]** So if they trickered anything, it was natural desires.

**[29:58 - 30:02]** But now these folks have this thing on their phones

**[30:02 - 30:06]** and young children.

**[30:06 - 30:10]** I'm talking about the power of imagination, thoughts, meditation.

**[30:10 - 30:14]** And I don't know, but once or twice a day

**[30:14 - 30:17]** whatever, they're looking at that stuff

**[30:17 - 30:18]** and they're not just fancy.

**[30:20 - 30:24]** They're focusing, they're meditating.

**[30:26 - 30:30]** They're meditating upon a man with a man.

**[30:31 - 30:34]** And that meditation is intensified by the fact

**[30:34 - 30:36]** that they're actually seeing it.

**[30:37 - 30:40]** So it's not just imagining it, it's seeing it

**[30:40 - 30:43]** but they're meditating on it.

**[30:43 - 30:48]** So the man is seeing and meditating on a man with a man.

**[30:49 - 30:57]** His brain is being rewired.

**[30:57 - 31:02]** If a woman is meditating a child, a young boy, a young girl,

**[31:02 - 31:04]** who had natural desires?

**[31:04 - 31:09]** Because he was born with his brain properly wired

**[31:09 - 31:14]** to connect him and his natural attractions to a female.

**[31:15 - 31:17]** But he begins to see this perversion

**[31:18 - 31:21]** and begins to meditate on it

**[31:21 - 31:25]** and all of a sudden the brain starts to rewire itself

**[31:25 - 31:27]** so that the natural affection that he should have

**[31:27 - 31:31]** for a woman is now being transferred

**[31:31 - 31:37]** by the brain to a man.

**[31:37 - 31:40]** And the same thing with females.

**[31:40 - 31:43]** So all of a sudden now after you've done

**[31:43 - 31:46]** meditate enough, you have changed.

**[31:46 - 31:49]** Unfortunately in the wrong way.

**[31:49 - 31:51]** So that now your natural attractions

**[31:51 - 31:54]** are no longer for the opposite sex.

**[31:54 - 31:58]** Your natural affections now are for your own kind

**[31:58 - 32:02]** because you spent all this time exposing your mind

**[32:02 - 32:05]** and rewiring your mind in such a way

**[32:05 - 32:12]** that your natural attractions now go the opposite.

**[32:12 - 32:15]** And then you hear people say, well, I can't help myself.

**[32:15 - 32:16]** That's the way I am.

**[32:16 - 32:20]** As a man thinking that it's hard, so is he.

**[32:20 - 32:23]** So yeah, this is the way they have become.

**[32:24 - 32:29]** But they became this way because they expose their minds

**[32:30 - 32:33]** and meditate it upon this stuff to such a degree

**[32:33 - 32:35]** that the mind has been rewired.

**[32:35 - 32:39]** And now when they see a man, they're triggered by a man.

**[32:39 - 32:42]** Or she sees a woman, she's triggered by a woman

**[32:42 - 32:44]** because her mind has been rewired.

**[32:47 - 32:48]** But here's a good news.

**[32:49 - 32:54]** If meditating on darkness can change you in such a way

**[32:55 - 33:00]** that you start to desire the things of darkness

**[33:01 - 33:03]** than meditating on light.

**[33:04 - 33:05]** Say hallelujah.

**[33:06 - 33:11]** If meditating on lies can change you so fundamentally

**[33:12 - 33:16]** that you start to be attracted to things that are not natural

**[33:16 - 33:20]** then meditating on the truth of God's word

**[33:20 - 33:23]** has the power, I want to say even more power,

**[33:23 - 33:28]** to change and transform your desires

**[33:28 - 33:32]** so that you begin to desire light and not darkness.

**[33:32 - 33:33]** Are you hear me?

**[33:33 - 33:36]** So that you start to love the things of God

**[33:36 - 33:37]** rather than the things of the world.

**[33:37 - 33:42]** But the key is you need to do what God told Joshua is to.

**[33:43 - 33:53]** All his day and so if you're struggling in any area

**[33:56 - 33:59]** in terms I want to do this when I keep doing this

**[33:59 - 34:00]** I want to, I keep feeling this.

**[34:00 - 34:02]** Hear me here is the solution.

**[34:02 - 34:06]** Take the word of God and meditate in it.

**[34:07 - 34:11]** Now we're not talking about just reading or hear it

**[34:11 - 34:14]** like you come and hear a sermon and that's done.

**[34:15 - 34:18]** Meditation requires, it's not complicated

**[34:18 - 34:23]** but it requires focus.

**[34:23 - 34:27]** It requires focus, sustain focus.

**[34:28 - 34:31]** Focus and tell you begin to feel it.

**[34:31 - 34:34]** You know you really meditate and now when

**[34:34 - 34:37]** what you have meditating on you actually start to feel

**[34:37 - 34:40]** you know what's your emotion start to become impacted

**[34:40 - 34:42]** by what you're meditating on.

**[34:42 - 34:44]** You know you've meditated on this verse long enough

**[34:44 - 34:49]** when you start to feel joy or peace or hope start to rise

**[34:52 - 34:54]** of you start to feel positive.

**[34:54 - 34:57]** You know you're meditating and the word of God

**[34:57 - 35:01]** is beginning to impact you.

**[35:01 - 35:04]** And you can do this and the more you do this

**[35:04 - 35:07]** the quicker you begin to experience the effect.

**[35:07 - 35:09]** But at first for some of us who haven't done this

**[35:09 - 35:13]** there'll be a struggle.

**[35:13 - 35:18]** But if you will make time to focus on the word

**[35:22 - 35:25]** and to meditate upon the thoughts,

**[35:25 - 35:27]** exchanging your thoughts for God's

**[35:27 - 35:30]** you will experience an inward change

**[35:30 - 35:32]** that will ultimately change the results

**[35:32 - 35:36]** that you're getting in Jesus' name.

**[35:36 - 35:38]** You may not change the people,

**[35:38 - 35:42]** you may not change the circumstances, but you'll be changed.

**[35:42 - 35:45]** And because you are changed you're gonna respond differently

**[35:45 - 35:49]** and you're gonna get different results for yourself

**[35:49 - 35:57]** if not for anybody else.

**[35:57 - 36:00]** And now the people who are clapping they're meditating.

**[36:00 - 36:05]** Because they're feeling it right?

**[36:05 - 36:08]** All right now so you need to do that with the scriptures

**[36:08 - 36:09]** and you need to do that with the word.

**[36:09 - 36:12]** The key is to define out the truth

**[36:12 - 36:14]** and meditate upon the truth.

**[36:14 - 36:16]** And so one way to discover the truth

**[36:16 - 36:21]** and the best way is to take the word read it and read it

**[36:22 - 36:23]** and read it.

**[36:23 - 36:26]** Hey man, in a sense you feed yourself with food you make

**[36:26 - 36:30]** you know you cook your own food and then you eat it.

**[36:31 - 36:33]** How many of you, nobody cooks for you,

**[36:33 - 36:36]** you cook for yourself, right?

**[36:36 - 36:38]** I saw a husband there.

**[36:38 - 36:39]** I saw a husband there.

**[36:39 - 36:41]** I saw a husband by the way that said

**[36:41 - 36:46]** his wife looked at him and he put his head back.

**[36:47 - 36:52]** If I told you I cook for myself I'll be lying.

**[36:52 - 36:55]** So I don't cook for myself by wife cooks

**[36:55 - 37:04]** and then I eat and I eat good while she has cooked.

**[37:06 - 37:10]** Thank God I have a wife who can cook good, right?

**[37:10 - 37:13]** Now she can cook the food and tell me it's ready

**[37:13 - 37:15]** if she gets upset right now because as soon as the food

**[37:15 - 37:17]** ready I must come.

**[37:17 - 37:20]** I came to finish what I'm doing.

**[37:20 - 37:22]** Once she says the food is ready if I don't get up

**[37:22 - 37:25]** immediately and go and eat I got trouble on my head.

**[37:25 - 37:32]** Even though she knows I don't complain her food is always good

**[37:32 - 37:35]** but I'm gonna stop whatever I'm talking about I'm gonna stop.

**[37:35 - 37:36]** That's five minutes.

**[37:36 - 37:41]** If I wait five minutes I'm in trouble.

**[37:41 - 37:44]** But she wants me to eat it and I need to eat it, right?

**[37:44 - 37:47]** In order for it to do me good.

**[37:47 - 37:49]** In this case I don't have to prepare

**[37:49 - 37:52]** but thank God many of you do prepare your food

**[37:52 - 37:54]** and then you feed on it.

**[37:54 - 37:56]** It is the same way with the word.

**[37:56 - 37:58]** Right now I prepared this meal.

**[37:58 - 38:02]** You didn't I cooked this for you.

**[38:02 - 38:05]** Amen?

**[38:05 - 38:07]** You were doing your own thing yesterday

**[38:07 - 38:09]** and you were doing your own thing Friday

**[38:09 - 38:11]** and you were doing your own thing last night.

**[38:11 - 38:14]** I was cooking.

**[38:14 - 38:15]** Say hallelujah.

**[38:17 - 38:19]** Say Bishop you cook well, you cook well last night.

**[38:19 - 38:24]** I was cooking, swatching and cooking.

**[38:24 - 38:28]** I hear me but hopefully the meal that is being served

**[38:28 - 38:29]** is good.

**[38:29 - 38:31]** But now you have a responsibility

**[38:31 - 38:35]** to take what has been cooked for you and eat it.

**[38:35 - 38:36]** And I give you five minutes

**[38:36 - 38:37]** and if you don't do it in five minutes

**[38:37 - 38:39]** you're out of being trouble.

**[38:39 - 38:39]** Ha ha ha ha.

**[38:41 - 38:43]** Don't let me talk to you on Wednesday

**[38:43 - 38:45]** and you haven't eaten my meal yet.

**[38:46 - 38:47]** Come on take it.

**[38:47 - 38:51]** It was cooked and prepared and if it's good meal then eat it.

**[38:51 - 38:54]** And that means you chew on it and you chew on it

**[38:54 - 38:57]** and you chew on it and you chew on it, you digest it.

**[38:58 - 39:01]** It meant that's good but all of us will get to the place

**[39:01 - 39:03]** where we can enjoy somebody else's food

**[39:03 - 39:08]** that has been cooked but that we also are able to cook

**[39:08 - 39:13]** our own meals and enjoy and digest what we have cooked

**[39:16 - 39:20]** in the presence of God that was strengthen us

**[39:20 - 39:26]** and cause us to experience good success, okay?

**[39:27 - 39:29]** So now I want us to get real practical.

**[39:29 - 39:31]** Let's go to my, I got a little PowerPoint

**[39:31 - 39:33]** I'm going to rush through it

**[39:33 - 39:34]** but I want to give you something

**[39:34 - 39:36]** and I think that's going to be a way for you

**[39:36 - 39:40]** to take it home and use it.

**[39:40 - 39:43]** So I just want to give you some practical steps.

**[39:43 - 39:46]** On last week I used the example of warring.

**[39:46 - 39:47]** I said if you know how to worry

**[39:47 - 39:50]** you know how to meditate

**[39:50 - 39:54]** but I want to just give you another way of thinking about it.

**[39:54 - 39:56]** These things are all important

**[39:56 - 39:58]** but you know it's not a certain order

**[39:58 - 40:00]** you're going to see them in an order

**[40:00 - 40:02]** doesn't mean this is the order you have to do it

**[40:02 - 40:06]** but these are all elements that hopefully will help you

**[40:06 - 40:11]** to now begin to practice daily meditation.

**[40:13 - 40:14]** Are you ready?

**[40:14 - 40:17]** All right so just walk me through this.

**[40:17 - 40:18]** So here are some practical steps.

**[40:19 - 40:23]** And here is one way to look at what you do when you meditate,

**[40:23 - 40:25]** okay?

**[40:25 - 40:28]** Mews, same mews, silently.

**[40:28 - 40:33]** You know what you get along with the word and with God

**[40:33 - 40:34]** and you begin to mews.

**[40:34 - 40:36]** That means you take that verse

**[40:36 - 40:39]** or that thought or that truth

**[40:39 - 40:43]** whatever it is that you're going to be meditating on

**[40:43 - 40:45]** and you just turn it over.

**[40:45 - 40:46]** You just turn that truth over.

**[40:46 - 40:47]** You turn that verse over.

**[40:47 - 40:49]** You just think about it.

**[40:49 - 40:51]** Let it roll through your mind.

**[40:51 - 40:53]** You think about what you're reading

**[40:53 - 40:55]** you think about the truth you heard today

**[40:55 - 40:57]** and just begin to ponder on it

**[40:57 - 41:00]** and think about it, let the thoughts arise.

**[41:00 - 41:03]** You know of course you begin all of this with prayer

**[41:03 - 41:04]** but that's musing.

**[41:04 - 41:07]** You're just going over it in your mind.

**[41:07 - 41:09]** Some of the things Bishop said you know

**[41:09 - 41:11]** that's why good illustration is so effective

**[41:11 - 41:12]** because you tend to remember

**[41:12 - 41:16]** technically illustrations go over in your mind.

**[41:16 - 41:17]** All right?

**[41:17 - 41:18]** I've said a number of things

**[41:18 - 41:20]** but then maybe one or two truths

**[41:20 - 41:24]** and really you know really you believe

**[41:24 - 41:27]** came from the word take it ponder it.

**[41:27 - 41:29]** Don't just leave your goal and forget about it.

**[41:29 - 41:31]** Make time to what?

**[41:31 - 41:33]** Think about it in your mind.

**[41:33 - 41:36]** Roll that thought over and over in your mind.

**[41:36 - 41:40]** Then mutter the actual Hebrew word

**[41:40 - 41:44]** for meditation is actually to mutter

**[41:44 - 41:47]** to involves using the mouth, right?

**[41:47 - 41:49]** So begin to mutter it.

**[41:49 - 41:53]** For instance, if the word is this book of the law

**[41:53 - 41:57]** shall not meditate, shall not depart from your mouth.

**[41:57 - 42:00]** You can begin to mutter it, this book, this word,

**[42:00 - 42:04]** this word, this word of grace, shall not.

**[42:04 - 42:06]** But you say quietly, I'm saying that a lot

**[42:06 - 42:07]** because I want you here but it's where it is.

**[42:07 - 42:11]** It's almost like you're whispering it, okay?

**[42:11 - 42:12]** But you keep whispering it.

**[42:12 - 42:13]** The key is to keep repeating.

**[42:13 - 42:15]** There's something about repetition

**[42:15 - 42:17]** that is important to meditation.

**[42:17 - 42:20]** So you take that thing that you thought about

**[42:20 - 42:23]** and then you begin to mutter it quietly

**[42:23 - 42:25]** under your breath, whispering.

**[42:26 - 42:30]** There at some point, move from just whispering

**[42:30 - 42:32]** to mouthing it strongly.

**[42:32 - 42:35]** You always open them out and start to say it.

**[42:35 - 42:36]** Say it strongly.

**[42:36 - 42:39]** Say it with confidence, okay?

**[42:39 - 42:42]** This book of the law, this word of grace, shall not,

**[42:43 - 42:46]** shall not depart from my mouth

**[42:46 - 42:51]** because I shall meditate, I shall meditate day and night.

**[42:51 - 42:52]** I shall meditate day and night.

**[42:52 - 42:56]** I shall meditate day and night.

**[42:56 - 42:57]** You understand?

**[42:57 - 43:01]** You begin to mouth it aloud so that you're both saying it

**[43:01 - 43:05]** and you're hearing it, repeat that.

**[43:05 - 43:10]** The key is what, to repeat it.

**[43:10 - 43:13]** And then number four, memorize.

**[43:13 - 43:15]** In other words, you don't memorize the verse

**[43:15 - 43:20]** or memorize the thought or memorize the truth, okay?

**[43:20 - 43:22]** And then store that in the heart.

**[43:22 - 43:25]** You want to memorize it so that it's there

**[43:25 - 43:27]** so that you can recall it.

**[43:27 - 43:29]** Because you don't wanna do this once.

**[43:29 - 43:32]** If you spend 15 minutes or 20 minutes

**[43:32 - 43:34]** just meditating on Joshua 1.8,

**[43:34 - 43:36]** then you gotta get up because you gotta go, right?

**[43:36 - 43:38]** You gotta go to work, you gotta take care of all of that.

**[43:38 - 43:39]** You gotta do that.

**[43:39 - 43:42]** But if you have memorized the thought

**[43:42 - 43:44]** so that you can recall it,

**[43:44 - 43:49]** then throughout the day, as you're doing other things,

**[43:49 - 43:51]** you can always do what?

**[43:51 - 43:53]** Recall it and you can mutter it.

**[43:53 - 43:56]** If you were people, you don't have to be speaking

**[43:56 - 43:58]** so loud that they can hear it.

**[43:58 - 44:01]** But you can actually be under your breath.

**[44:01 - 44:04]** Throughout the day, this word of grace,

**[44:04 - 44:07]** this word of grace shall not be part of my eyes.

**[44:07 - 44:11]** I shall meditate upon it.

**[44:11 - 44:13]** I am meditating upon it.

**[44:13 - 44:14]** You follow me?

**[44:14 - 44:17]** So you wanna memorize the truth or the truths?

**[44:18 - 44:21]** Store it so you can recall it throughout the day.

**[44:21 - 44:23]** So quickly, let's go through this.

**[44:23 - 44:27]** Muse, everybody, no go back, please.

**[44:29 - 44:33]** Muse, silently, mutter, softly,

**[44:33 - 44:38]** mouth it strongly, memorize it.

**[44:39 - 44:41]** You can use this outline as a short outline

**[44:41 - 44:44]** to help you remember the major parts of meditation.

**[44:44 - 44:46]** Let's go to another outline.

**[44:46 - 44:48]** This is longer.

**[44:48 - 44:50]** It just reinforces these things,

**[44:50 - 44:52]** but it highlights some other things

**[44:52 - 44:53]** that I want you to know.

**[44:53 - 44:55]** So what I did, I took the word meditate

**[44:55 - 44:58]** and I created an acronym that I believe it again

**[44:58 - 45:02]** highlights for you what's important

**[45:02 - 45:03]** when it comes to meditation.

**[45:03 - 45:05]** And when you say, I'm gonna meditate,

**[45:05 - 45:09]** these are the things that you're deciding you're gonna do, okay?

**[45:09 - 45:11]** All right, see everybody taking it, taking it.

**[45:11 - 45:13]** That's good, go ahead and take it.

**[45:14 - 45:15]** No, that's fine.

**[45:15 - 45:17]** But here's the first thing.

**[45:17 - 45:19]** When you meditate, you wanna do what?

**[45:19 - 45:22]** You got to, if you're gonna meditate day and night guys,

**[45:22 - 45:24]** you're gonna have to make time.

**[45:24 - 45:25]** You're gonna have to decide.

**[45:25 - 45:30]** You're gonna have to make time to be alone with God and His Word.

**[45:32 - 45:34]** Our schedules are all different,

**[45:34 - 45:37]** so you choose what works for you.

**[45:37 - 45:40]** Some people would say, I'm gonna meditate 6 a.m.

**[45:40 - 45:42]** every morning from six to six,

**[45:42 - 45:45]** or from six to six, 15 or from six to seven o'clock.

**[45:45 - 45:48]** And it's gonna work for them.

**[45:48 - 45:49]** If it's gonna work for you,

**[45:49 - 45:53]** then make up your mind today every morning at six o'clock.

**[45:53 - 45:55]** Somebody else would say, it doesn't matter when I wake up,

**[45:55 - 45:59]** but the first thing I do when I wake up, I'm gonna meditate.

**[45:59 - 46:02]** So if you sleep long, you get up,

**[46:02 - 46:03]** the first thing you're gonna do is meditate.

**[46:03 - 46:05]** So you may tie your meditation,

**[46:05 - 46:07]** not necessarily about a particular hour,

**[46:07 - 46:12]** but just after a particular activity.

**[46:12 - 46:13]** You follow me?

**[46:13 - 46:17]** The key is don't just leave it and hope it happens,

**[46:17 - 46:18]** because if you leave it,

**[46:18 - 46:22]** a simple hope meditation will happen, I guarantee you,

**[46:22 - 46:25]** there will be so many things that will take your time

**[46:25 - 46:28]** that you will not engage in deep meditation.

**[46:30 - 46:31]** Is that so?

**[46:31 - 46:32]** All right, so that's where it starts.

**[46:32 - 46:35]** A life of victory and success.

**[46:35 - 46:38]** If you want to fulfill God's assignment,

**[46:38 - 46:40]** experience, prosperity, and good success

**[46:40 - 46:41]** in doing the will of God,

**[46:41 - 46:46]** say I have to make time for meditation.

**[46:50 - 46:53]** Amen, make time.

**[46:53 - 46:58]** To E, embrace silence and stillness.

**[46:59 - 47:02]** I know we forecast what charismatic people,

**[47:02 - 47:06]** sometimes we think silence is of the devil.

**[47:07 - 47:11]** You know, we think silence is fleshly, all right?

**[47:11 - 47:14]** Talking and action, that's spiritual.

**[47:14 - 47:19]** But hear me, you know, Jesus will often get up in the morning.

**[47:20 - 47:23]** The Bible says a long while before day

**[47:23 - 47:25]** and he will go to be alone.

**[47:26 - 47:31]** What was he embraced in solitude, silence and stillness?

**[47:31 - 47:36]** So wherever you choose to meditate,

**[47:36 - 47:40]** to really engage in deep meditation,

**[47:40 - 47:45]** you need to find a place where you can be silence, still,

**[47:45 - 47:47]** and by yourself.

**[47:47 - 47:50]** It's wonderful for us to be together

**[47:50 - 47:53]** and there are times when we must be together.

**[47:53 - 47:57]** But then there are times when spiritual growth requires

**[47:57 - 48:02]** solitude, silence, stillness.

**[48:02 - 48:07]** Jesus says, open the door of your closet, shut the door.

**[48:07 - 48:09]** And what was he saying, basically,

**[48:09 - 48:15]** delimited distractions, outward distractions,

**[48:15 - 48:17]** inward distractions?

**[48:17 - 48:18]** I don't know.

**[48:18 - 48:21]** For you and me nowadays, I think that cell phone

**[48:21 - 48:31]** is extremely good, but it's probably your number one enemy.

**[48:31 - 48:33]** It's mine, okay?

**[48:33 - 48:37]** And I assume that it's probably your number one enemy

**[48:37 - 48:41]** that really, really hinders silence and stillness.

**[48:41 - 48:44]** Because even when you close the door in your closet,

**[48:44 - 48:46]** you take the phone with you.

**[48:46 - 48:56]** And the phone is not on airplane mode or something.

**[48:56 - 49:04]** You got it on and still you're praying.

**[49:04 - 49:06]** And you take a look at him more closely.

**[49:06 - 49:08]** Who said from, I wonder why he calling me?

**[49:08 - 49:10]** Oh, I need to call him.

**[49:10 - 49:12]** You've been interrupted.

**[49:12 - 49:13]** You put it down.

**[49:13 - 49:16]** There's an email that has come.

**[49:16 - 49:20]** I'm going to talk about so for us guys, for most of us,

**[49:20 - 49:28]** one of the first things we got to remove from our space

**[49:28 - 49:33]** when it comes to meditation is our electronic stuff we have.

**[49:33 - 49:37]** Either cut it off or put it on silence where you can't interrupt you.

**[49:37 - 49:41]** Because if you take it with you, it's going to prevent you

**[49:41 - 49:43]** from truly being alone.

**[49:43 - 49:46]** Because all the people who have access to your number

**[49:46 - 49:47]** you brought them with you.

**[49:47 - 49:52]** All right?

**[49:52 - 49:54]** D.

**[49:54 - 49:56]** Determine your focus.

**[49:56 - 49:58]** Well, let me say something.

**[49:58 - 50:03]** Other embrace stillness and silence include quiet worship.

**[50:03 - 50:04]** All right?

**[50:04 - 50:10]** So you're still, you're silent, you're with God by yourself.

**[50:10 - 50:14]** At some point you can enter into silent worship

**[50:14 - 50:18]** because one of the ways to be still on my soul,

**[50:18 - 50:25]** one of the ways to steal the inner voices and noises is through worship.

**[50:25 - 50:30]** Not loud worship, not silent, quiet worship, soft worship.

**[50:30 - 50:33]** Okay?

**[50:33 - 50:36]** Because that will help you to steal the inner noises.

**[50:36 - 50:41]** Leaving your phone outside will help you steal the outward noises.

**[50:41 - 50:46]** But the inner noises can be distracting too.

**[50:46 - 50:50]** You've got to find a way to shut that bottle mouth

**[50:50 - 50:54]** that you keep hearing when you're in the prayer closet.

**[50:54 - 51:00]** Because he keeps making noise in your head.

**[51:00 - 51:01]** D.

**[51:01 - 51:04]** So now when you're still in your worshiping

**[51:04 - 51:07]** and you're just in the Lord's presence,

**[51:07 - 51:12]** often he will direct, often you will get a thought

**[51:12 - 51:15]** that directs you to a particular verse if you don't already have a verse.

**[51:15 - 51:18]** Sometimes you're going to the prayer closet already knowing

**[51:18 - 51:20]** what you're going to meditate on.

**[51:20 - 51:22]** But if you don't know what you're going to meditate on,

**[51:22 - 51:26]** while you're worshiping and while you're just enjoying his presence,

**[51:26 - 51:30]** thoughts will come to your mind that will direct you

**[51:30 - 51:34]** to a particular verse of scripture or particular truth

**[51:34 - 51:37]** or particular aspects of God's character.

**[51:37 - 51:38]** Right?

**[51:38 - 51:41]** You have to determine now what you're going to spend your time focusing on.

**[51:41 - 51:43]** What truth?

**[51:43 - 51:45]** What text?

**[51:45 - 51:48]** Are you going to focus on for the next 15 minutes, 30 minutes,

**[51:48 - 51:52]** one hour, two hours, depending on how long you're going to be there?

**[51:52 - 51:53]** Determine that.

**[51:53 - 51:56]** And what you determine that start to dig.

**[51:56 - 51:58]** What do I mean?

**[51:58 - 52:01]** Begin to ask questions.

**[52:01 - 52:03]** Are you following me?

**[52:03 - 52:04]** Am I giving you too much?

**[52:04 - 52:06]** You're listening?

**[52:06 - 52:07]** Okay.

**[52:07 - 52:09]** What you want to do now, say you determine

**[52:09 - 52:12]** that the text of the truth you're going to meditate on,

**[52:12 - 52:15]** is the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

**[52:15 - 52:16]** Say that.

**[52:16 - 52:19]** The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want that verse.

**[52:19 - 52:21]** That's all you're going to meditate on.

**[52:21 - 52:22]** Right?

**[52:22 - 52:24]** So you've determined that's the verse.

**[52:24 - 52:26]** Now you want to dig.

**[52:26 - 52:29]** You want to dig to see what God wants to say.

**[52:29 - 52:32]** Then what will help you to dig questions?

**[52:32 - 52:33]** That's a great answer.

**[52:33 - 52:39]** I'll also say, is it a four eight W's or five W's and one and eight?

**[52:39 - 52:40]** Ask questions.

**[52:40 - 52:41]** Who?

**[52:41 - 52:43]** The Lord.

**[52:43 - 52:44]** Who?

**[52:44 - 52:46]** Who is this Lord?

**[52:46 - 52:49]** Jesus.

**[52:49 - 52:51]** But who is Jesus?

**[52:51 - 52:52]** Son of God.

**[52:52 - 52:54]** But who is Jesus?

**[52:54 - 52:57]** That's a rational life.

**[52:57 - 52:58]** But who is Jesus?

**[52:58 - 53:00]** My shepherd?

**[53:00 - 53:03]** You begin to ask questions.

**[53:03 - 53:04]** Who?

**[53:04 - 53:07]** What?

**[53:07 - 53:08]** The Lord is my shepherd.

**[53:08 - 53:09]** I shall not want.

**[53:09 - 53:12]** What does that mean for the Lord to be my shepherd?

**[53:12 - 53:13]** What?

**[53:13 - 53:18]** That's a shepherd Jew.

**[53:18 - 53:24]** Why is it a benefit for the Lord to be my shepherd and ask someone else?

**[53:24 - 53:30]** Why is it better for the Lord to be my shepherd and not my job?

**[53:30 - 53:35]** You see?

**[53:35 - 53:38]** Now, that thought just came to me.

**[53:38 - 53:41]** It wasn't in my mind before I came.

**[53:41 - 53:42]** But I'm actually meditating.

**[53:42 - 53:43]** I'm digging.

**[53:43 - 53:51]** And as I ask these questions, my mind is opening up more to appreciate what it means

**[53:51 - 53:55]** to have the Lord ask my shepherd.

**[53:55 - 53:57]** Say, what?

**[53:57 - 53:59]** Who?

**[53:59 - 54:01]** How?

**[54:01 - 54:02]** When?

**[54:02 - 54:04]** When is the Lord my shepherd?

**[54:04 - 54:08]** Is it after I die?

**[54:08 - 54:09]** When is the Lord my shepherd?

**[54:09 - 54:12]** Is it sometime in the past?

**[54:12 - 54:13]** The Lord is.

**[54:13 - 54:14]** That's that.

**[54:14 - 54:16]** Oh, that's present tense.

**[54:16 - 54:17]** I'm meditating.

**[54:17 - 54:19]** Oh, none of these things were in my mind.

**[54:19 - 54:22]** But because I'm digging, all of these things are coming.

**[54:22 - 54:23]** Wow.

**[54:23 - 54:24]** Present tense.

**[54:24 - 54:29]** Now, what does it mean?

**[54:29 - 54:37]** How does it feel to have him, my shepherd?

**[54:37 - 54:39]** What does a shepherd do?

**[54:39 - 54:41]** A shepherd protects.

**[54:41 - 54:42]** Whoa.

**[54:42 - 54:43]** Wow.

**[54:43 - 54:48]** I feel like to know the Lord is protecting me now.

**[54:48 - 54:57]** Now, I can see myself in a situation where there was lions, and I will normally be afraid.

**[54:57 - 54:59]** But now I see the Lord is with me.

**[54:59 - 55:02]** I see the shepherd is by my side.

**[55:02 - 55:07]** How do I feel when I'm facing a lion for the shepherd is by my side?

**[55:07 - 55:09]** Am I afraid?

**[55:09 - 55:10]** No.

**[55:10 - 55:18]** I'm full of courage because I know the shepherd is protecting me.

**[55:18 - 55:21]** So you're digging by asking questions.

**[55:21 - 55:26]** What, who, where, when, how?

**[55:26 - 55:27]** Why?

**[55:27 - 55:28]** All right?

**[55:28 - 55:29]** So important.

**[55:29 - 55:33]** Now, here is something I suggest.

**[55:33 - 55:38]** I suggest that as these revelations or new thoughts begin to come to you, record them.

**[55:38 - 55:39]** Write them down.

**[55:39 - 55:42]** So have a little notebook so you can just jot the thought down.

**[55:42 - 55:45]** Because what you want to do next is you want to internalize.

**[55:45 - 55:48]** That's what I say internalize.

**[55:48 - 55:52]** I want to do what?

**[55:52 - 55:53]** E.

**[55:53 - 55:54]** Journalize.

**[55:54 - 55:57]** The word in other words, I want to digest it.

**[55:57 - 55:58]** Okay?

**[55:58 - 56:00]** I was asking questions.

**[56:00 - 56:02]** I was getting good information.

**[56:02 - 56:03]** I was getting knowledge.

**[56:03 - 56:04]** I was getting truth.

**[56:04 - 56:07]** But I don't want to leave the truth on the paper.

**[56:07 - 56:11]** I want the truth on the paper to get inside of me.

**[56:11 - 56:12]** Please listen.

**[56:12 - 56:15]** Here's what happens when you're meditating.

**[56:15 - 56:16]** What should be happening?

**[56:16 - 56:21]** The truth that is before you.

**[56:21 - 56:25]** That which you are seeing or you are hearing.

**[56:25 - 56:32]** You want that truth to move from your eyes or from your ears.

**[56:32 - 56:35]** You want to move that truth into your head.

**[56:35 - 56:40]** Man, the way you're looking.

**[56:40 - 56:41]** I don't know.

**[56:41 - 56:45]** All right.

**[56:45 - 56:47]** Move your truth.

**[56:47 - 56:52]** Move that truth from the pages or from the sermon.

**[56:52 - 56:54]** Into your head.

**[56:54 - 56:59]** Then you want it to travel from your head to your heart.

**[56:59 - 57:03]** Then you want it to travel from your heart to your hands.

**[57:03 - 57:05]** Where you're doing it.

**[57:05 - 57:09]** And then you want to travel from your hand to your habits.

**[57:09 - 57:16]** So this is something that you are habitually doing.

**[57:16 - 57:18]** And that's why you must internalize it.

**[57:18 - 57:20]** Because if you do that internalize it,

**[57:20 - 57:25]** it will not move from the pages or from the sermon to your head,

**[57:25 - 57:32]** to your heart, to your hands, and to your habits.

**[57:32 - 57:35]** So now you want to do that internalize the words.

**[57:35 - 57:37]** So the thoughts that you have written,

**[57:37 - 57:42]** you want now to begin to think and repeat and think and repeat.

**[57:42 - 57:48]** And this is where you use your imagination.

**[57:48 - 57:50]** If you're taking notes right that down.

**[57:50 - 57:52]** This is where you use your imagination.

**[57:52 - 57:55]** To actually internalize the truth,

**[57:55 - 57:57]** you use your imagination.

**[57:57 - 58:01]** That is what quite God gave you, your imagination.

**[58:01 - 58:04]** The fastest way to get the word from your head to your heart

**[58:04 - 58:07]** to your hands to your life is to use your imagination.

**[58:07 - 58:12]** In our envision, what the word is talking about.

**[58:12 - 58:17]** The Bible says, the Holy Spirit will give visions.

**[58:17 - 58:20]** The Holy Spirit guides us in the truth, right?

**[58:20 - 58:23]** But the scripture says he will give visions.

**[58:23 - 58:25]** In other words, one of the primary ways

**[58:25 - 58:28]** by which the Holy Spirit can communicate and review truth to you

**[58:28 - 58:32]** is by opening the eyes of your heart and helping you to see

**[58:32 - 58:40]** what the word is saying, right?

**[58:40 - 58:42]** So here is when you ask the Lord,

**[58:42 - 58:45]** Lord helping to see what I'm reading.

**[58:45 - 58:48]** So if Jesus, if the disciples are on the boat

**[58:48 - 58:50]** and there's a storm raging,

**[58:50 - 58:52]** what do you want to see?

**[58:52 - 58:54]** The disciples on the boat,

**[58:54 - 58:58]** the storm raging, and they are afraid.

**[58:58 - 59:00]** Then you want to see Jesus.

**[59:00 - 59:01]** What is Jesus doing?

**[59:01 - 59:04]** You want to see Jesus in that same storm?

**[59:04 - 59:06]** Imagine it, envision it.

**[59:06 - 59:08]** What are the sounds you're hearing?

**[59:08 - 59:09]** And some of you who are creative.

**[59:09 - 59:13]** This is where you can have a lot of fun.

**[59:13 - 59:16]** The sounds, you can see the waves,

**[59:16 - 59:18]** you can see the boat.

**[59:18 - 59:20]** You see the disciples afraid,

**[59:20 - 59:22]** but you're looking the corner of the boat,

**[59:22 - 59:26]** and you don't know what.

**[59:26 - 59:29]** Now, which one are you going to identify with?

**[59:29 - 59:32]** Are you going to identify with the disciples?

**[59:32 - 59:34]** If you do, and you see yourself,

**[59:34 - 59:36]** like one of the disciples,

**[59:36 - 59:39]** you're going to start up some real fear.

**[59:39 - 59:41]** And you're going to start trembling.

**[59:41 - 59:44]** But if you look at Jesus and say,

**[59:44 - 59:47]** oh no, I'm identifying with Jesus.

**[59:47 - 59:51]** That's the image God wants to conform me to.

**[59:51 - 59:53]** So now you see Jesus living,

**[59:53 - 59:55]** and where do you see yourself?

**[59:55 - 59:57]** You don't see yourself with the rest of these disciples.

**[59:57 - 01:00:00]** You see yourself leaning down and sleeping.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** The boat is going up.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Don't see the sea calm,

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** because right now your life isn't calm.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** See the storm that is happening.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:12]** But see yourself sleeping,

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]** resting, not afraid, calm.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** And every time you're tempted to be afraid,

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** you look over and you see Jesus.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** So am I.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** What are you doing?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:32]** You are internalizing the word,

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** so that the word starts to transform

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:36]** the way you think, the way you believe,

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** the way you feel,

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** and ultimately the way you behave.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** When you get through that,

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** you get up and the storm is still raging.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** That experience you had

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** has already started to change you.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:51]** You may have to do that every day for a while,

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:59]** until the full effect is manifested.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** Do it the same way you are getting with your temper,

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** your anger.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** If you always get angry because somebody criticizes you,

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** is that the image of Christ?

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** How are you going to change where,

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** instead of becoming angry,

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** you are weak.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** You are strong,

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:21]** but your emotions are under your control.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** How are you going to be transformed?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** Tell me.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** Tell me.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Everybody should answer.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Tell me.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** You are going to look at Jesus,

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** or look at a scripture

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** that calls you to weakness,

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** to gentleness,

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:42]** and you are going to meditate on that word,

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** dig in deep.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:45]** I will tell you that you get enough revelation

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** from that word,

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** you write it down,

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:50]** and then you make that what you are going to focus your thoughts on

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]** and engage your imagination.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Amen?

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:57]** So if now the Lord is calling you to be gentle,

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:01]** but your natural response from the old man is to be angry,

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** go ahead and take the person who makes you angry the most,

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:11]** see that person doing what he has to always does

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** to make you angry.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:20]** But this time imagine yourself doing the word.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** Imagine yourself not striking back,

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** not yelling,

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** not having to defend yourself,

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:29]** imagine yourself responding calmly.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** Imagine yourself on the cross,

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** say, Father,

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** forgive them.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** They know not what they do.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]** Are you hear me?

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:42]** Yes, so instead of seeing yourself being angry,

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** change the picture.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** The person is there,

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** they are doing what they do,

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** and here you are acting like Jesus.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** Father,

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** forgive them.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** They know not what they do.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** Here you are acting like Stephen.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** Oh, Father,

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** don't lay this to their charge.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:07]** That's the image of Christ.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** And right now when you're angry,

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** you're not acting out who you are.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** You are that in your spirit,

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** but it's not being expressed openly.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** By meditating when you see yourself

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** fulfilling scripture,

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** doing what God requires you to do,

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** your brain will get we wide.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:26]** And just like people become

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** aware of something they were not born to be

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** because of meditation,

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** all of a sudden what was not natural to you?

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Yeah, you were born in September.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]** Yeah, September people are known for having quick temper.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:39]** And by the way, I was born in September.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:42]** And there was a time.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** I don't know,

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** I need to meditate still a little bit more,

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:48]** but there was a time.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** It was not easy for me to cut you.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** That was a Christian.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Much younger.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** I was still in my teenage years.

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:00]** But there were just certain things that would trigger me.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:03]** And I had some very rare words that would come out of my mouth.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:08]** But those words have been come out of my mouth down for decades.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:12]** What?

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:17]** My image of my self-change through meditation.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** I didn't just hear the word,

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** I internalized.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Man, I used to,

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** there was a day of the,

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:26]** what do you call it tape, the cassette.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]** I used to take sermons and listen to sermons over

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:32]** and that's why I don't understand y'all.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:36]** Seriously,

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** I mean, you got quite a word of this place

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** and you don't listen,

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** you hardly listen when it's being spoken.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:47]** Then you don't even bother to take it again and,

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** hey, how do you expect your growing change?

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** How do you expect your ever become fully mature

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:56]** if you don't prioritize the word and meditating in the word?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:59]** How do you expect to change?

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** There's some things you tolerate in your life right now.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:05]** The only reason you tolerate it because you don't meditate.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** If you meditate it in God's word,

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:10]** your image of yourself was so changed that you said,

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** I can't do that.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]** I cannot wear that.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:18]** I cannot go out looking like this.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:20]** I cannot say those words.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]** I cannot let that vulgar word come out.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** I hear Christians sometimes on Facebook,

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** cussing.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** And then the next minute they're praising God.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:33]** And thanking God and how God has been good to them.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** You are a Christian, you are a believer,

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:38]** and you can tolerate that kind of nonsense coming out

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:42]** of your mouth.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Why?

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** You haven't meditate enough to see yourself

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:47]** as who you are in Christ.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:51]** You got religion, that's it.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** You said basically what you're doing.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** I see Jesus driving out there.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** The money changes.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:00]** I see Jesus driving out the money changes out of the temple.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:02]** And man, right now I see it so I am.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:04]** Something driving the money changes.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:07]** The truth is love has to rebuke sometimes.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:12]** I hear me rebuke in love, but really,

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:17]** there's just too much nonsense that we do it.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** And we call ourselves Christians.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** That is no different from other world does.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:26]** And the only reason we're okay with that is we're not

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** spending enough time meditating in Scripture.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** We got religion.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** But it would really, really have a relationship with Jesus.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:36]** And we really, really was meditating upon this word.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:39]** And see who he is and see what he thinks about sin.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:43]** If we were replacing our thoughts about sin with his thoughts.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:47]** If we were replacing our thoughts about the world with his thoughts,

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** the things we would not tolerate.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** You don't need a rule.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** You just won't want to do it.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:57]** And when you do it, you will feel so out of place.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:01]** Oh God, hurry up.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** Internalize the word.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** Talk with God.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:09]** Let's turn the truth or the meditation into prayer.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** Talk with God.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Make that word a prayer.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** The Lord is my Lord.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** Wow.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:18]** I thank you all for being my shepherd.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]** From me to have you as a shepherd.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:25]** What have I done to deserve it?

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** To have you watching about me protecting me and guiding me?

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:30]** Thank you, Lord.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:32]** Lord, you are my shepherd.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** And the Scripture says, I shall not want it.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:36]** So Lord, I just want you to know.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:40]** Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for wisdom today.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:47]** Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for peace in this crisis.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:51]** Since you are my shepherd, I shall not want for sleep.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** I will sleep in Jesus' name.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** What are you doing?

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:58]** You take the word of the truth and you turn it into prayer.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:02]** You make it the basis of a conversation with God.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:08]** And as you are doing that, that word is getting on the inside of you more and more and more.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** Now your meditation has a magic prayer.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** And it's not just empty words.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:15]** It's prayer that is filled with faith.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:18]** Because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:24]** As you have meditated upon the word faith as a reason you turn that knowledge of prayer.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:30]** And the Lord hears the prayers of the righteous man.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** All right?

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:33]** So let's rush through the other pieces.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** A is what?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** To apply the truth.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:38]** So now you got to say you meditated on the truth.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** You heard what Bishop said today.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** Now you can't say you got to apply it.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:45]** You got to say now what am I supposed to do today?

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Because of this truth.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** Say this.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** This is application.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:50]** What should I know?

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** Say no.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:54]** What should I believe?

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:57]** What should I do?

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:04]** And when you look at Psalm 231, what should I know?

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:08]** What should I now believe?

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:14]** What lies should I stop believing because of this truth?

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:19]** What should I do as a result of what I just learned?

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:22]** You hear me?

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:25]** Because you want to apply the words.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** You want to put it into practice.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:29]** And when you start putting the word into practice,

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:32]** that's when the power transformation kicks in.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:36]** And you begin to see yourself changing in ways that you didn't realize.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:38]** I'm not saying there's no battle.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** But you keep pressing in,

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:42]** and the word will eventually prevail.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:45]** T.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]** Think on it what?

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:51]** So yeah, deep meditation requires that you are alone and you're focused,

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:54]** but you can't be in the closet all day.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:58]** And you're in the closet all day, I will rebuke you.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:02]** Because the word says the man does not work, he should not.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:07]** So God knows there are times that you must be in the closet alone,

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:11]** but there are times you need to be at work.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:14]** And there are times you need to be in church.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:17]** I hear me, there's work to be done in the kingdom.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** All right, so by hear me, thank God,

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:23]** you can take the word with you.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:26]** You won't be able to engage in deep meditation,

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** but wherever you go,

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** quietly, you can be meditating.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:34]** You can be muttering this word all the time.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:39]** Use your mouth and keep uttering the word.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:42]** Don't listen to music all day.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:45]** Mutter, mutter, much of the word.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:49]** Don't leave the breakfast you had with God

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:52]** if you meditate in the morning.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:55]** Don't leave that on the breakfast table and go.

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:58]** Take it with you.

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:00]** Think on it.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:03]** Whatever is true, whatever is no but et cetera.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Think on it.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:06]** You make a decision throughout the day.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** You're going to be muttering that truth.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:10]** Today, tomorrow, the next day,

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** keep rolling it in your mind,

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** keep muttering it under your lips,

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** and when you can't keep voicing it aloud.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** Lastly, say to your neighbor,

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** enjoy the Lord.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** Enjoy the word is sweet.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:26]** David said, oh, how I love your law.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:32]** It should be my meditations all the day long.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:34]** Enjoy the word.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]** Enjoy the grace of God.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]** Enjoy the love of God.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** Enjoy the friendship of the Holy Spirit

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:43]** and expect fruit,

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:48]** much fruit, to be the result of your meditation.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:51]** Because this is what the Lord says in Psalm chapter 2.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** I'll close with this.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:57]** Blessed is that man who walks not.

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:00]** Walks right?

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** Walks right in the counsel of the

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:05]** Lord stands in the way of the sinner.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:08]** Lord sits in the seat of the

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]** but here's the light.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** Here's what.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Here's the light.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** It's not a duty.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** Here's the light.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:16]** Say that here's the light.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** It's in the law.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:20]** We say in the word of the law.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:24]** And in his word, does he do what?

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:27]** Meditate day and night.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** And he shall be like what?

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:33]** A tree planted by the rivers of water

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]** that will bring forth his fruit in his season.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:41]** His leaves shall never wither.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:44]** And whatsoever he does,

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:46]** shall prosper.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:49]** Say hallelujah.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:52]** Hallelujah.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** Hallelujah.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** Amen.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:58]** We who meditate are like the tree.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** Plant it.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:02]** That means nothing moves us.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:07]** Bad news doesn't move me.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Good news.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:12]** Maybe moves me a little.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:14]** But my moving is not what he based

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** upon my circumstance.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:17]** I move by the goodness of God.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:19]** I move by the grace of God.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** I move by the faithfulness of God.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:23]** And that is constant.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** That doesn't change.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** When things become bad,

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** God is still good.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:28]** When things are good, God is still

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** gooder.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** Say hallelujah.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:32]** So when my delight is in the Lord,

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:34]** then really my circumstances don't

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** really move me.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:38]** I don't get happy because something

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** happened because I'm already

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:41]** happened because Jesus happened.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:46]** Amen.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:49]** Now, here's the call to action.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:53]** Do something today

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:56]** about what you've heard.

**[01:13:56 - 01:14:00]** Start meditating today.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:02]** You can take the meal.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:05]** I just fetch provided for you the

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:08]** meditate on or you can cook your own.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:11]** But you start today.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:13]** You don't need a long verse.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:15]** You don't need a lot of verses.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:17]** Start with one verse.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:19]** Start with one truth.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:22]** But begin to meditate today.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:25]** And ask the Holy Spirit to cause you

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:28]** to increase your meditation.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:30]** Because you see the more you meditate,

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:33]** the more you soak your mind in the word of God,

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]** the more it transforms your life.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:37]** And it makes you like God.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:39]** Did you hear that?

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:41]** A man who thinks

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:45]** like God will start to act like God,

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:48]** will start to talk like God,

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:51]** will start to walk in success

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:53]** like God.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:57]** That is your portion.

**[01:14:57 - 01:15:00]** That's my portion in Jesus' name.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:02]** Amen.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:04]** Amen.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** Amen.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** Now, if you're going to be a do of

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:09]** this word, I want you to stand.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:21]** If all of these do us,

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:23]** if all of these who are committing to

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:25]** doing the word, actually go ahead and do the word,

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:29]** we have a new church.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:31]** This church has to come brand new.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:35]** You hear me?

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:37]** Father, I pray that you see each person,

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:39]** each person, each man,

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** each woman who is standing up,

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:42]** you see their heart.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:44]** And the decision that they have made

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:46]** concerning meditation,

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:49]** that they will be like the sound one man,

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:53]** who will meditate in your word continually.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** And I thank you that because they

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:57]** will meditate in your word,

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:00]** they will be like a tree planted

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:02]** by the rivers of water.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:04]** They will be stable and unmovable.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:08]** They will be fruitful in the name of Jesus.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:11]** They will bear fruit for your glory.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** In the name of Jesus, regardless

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:14]** of the changes around them,

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** they will remain the same steadfast

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:18]** and fruitful because they are planted

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:21]** by the rivers of water.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:22]** And through meditation,

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:24]** they are receiving that water

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:28]** that gives them life and strength and wisdom.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** Thank you, O God.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:34]** Holy Spirit, keep this message on their minds.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:38]** Keep reminding them until they take action.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:41]** I pray that this word will not be stolen

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:43]** in the name of Jesus.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:45]** Let this word be received and let it be

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:47]** approved in each of us.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]** In Jesus name, I pray.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** Amen.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Amen. God bless you.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** You may be seated.

I'm going to briefly introduce our guest minister. His name is Pastor James Mujango, all the way from Rwanda. Pastor James is the senior pastor of the Father's Hand Church.

Church, let us stand and welcome the men of God with a word of God for us this morning. You may please have your seat. Thank you, Marvin. Thank you, Marvin. Good morning, harvesters. I just want to start by thanking God for this wonderful occasion. He's given me to be here and I want to thank Bishop Johnson Daringstone in his absence and Pastor Chris for extending this invitation to me. We've not known each other for very long, but the short time we go to know each other, we go connected. Amen. And I want to thank them so much. May the good Lord bless them and entire leadership and want also to thank one of the elders here, our sister, all the way from Rwanda. She's the ambassador of Rwanda here and you all know her. Do you know her? Elder Antoine Nates. Elder Antoine Nates. She has been the connecting link for me in this church. Thank you so much Elder Antoine Nates. The Lord bless you. And I want to thank all my family members who are in the house here. They just came to be with us today in this service, but for them they're here in the U.S. and I know some of them are going to stay in this church. Okay. So let me kindly request whoever is here with me to stand up. And Antigoli, she works with the Ugandan Embassy here in the U.S. And I'm mavin. Are you with someone?

Tell your neighbor you're so full of grace. Amen. So I don't know how much you love your senior pastors and your pastor team, but I just want to let you know that you have wonderful wonderful leaders wonderful leaders. And I've got I've got time to follow up some of the teachings of Dr. Daringstone. And I can tell you each each one of them I can I can repreach them because of how deep and reverational they are. Talk about meditation that leads what? Amen. Talk about the higher life, isn't it? And talk about being counted among the what? The grateful, isn't it? Those are some of the summons that have been told and they have been a great blessing to me the time I've been following them. Amen. So let's appreciate the man of God for the wonderful work. Now this morning as I was I mean, not this morning when I was given the chance the opportunity to say to share the word of God, I prayed about it. And I like it so much when I'm told that let the Holy Spirit lead you. And that's what actually Bishop said. Just do as the Holy Spirit leads you. Are you ready to receive the Holy Spirit administration this morning? So our study this morning is going to be based in the book of Luke chapter one from verse chapter five, sorry, from for the first verse to the foot to the fourth verse. Look chapter five, verse one to four. And the Bible reads, I'll be reading from the new leading translation. It says on one occasion while Jesus was standing by the leg of Genesareta with the crowd pressing in on him to hear the word of God. He saw two boats, how many boats? Two boats at the age of the leg. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. Jesus got into the boat belonging to who? To Simon and asked him to put out a little from the shore and sitting down. He taught the people from the boat. When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, put out into deep water and let down your nets for recouch. They are heavily fathered this morning as we share this what I pray that your Holy Spirit will be moving in this room. May the Holy Spirit bring reveration and breathe upon every spoken word to bring life. Your word says the entrance of your word, the reveration of your word brings light, let that light shine in every heart in Jesus name. Amen. Verse five, it says, Master Simon replied, we have worked hard all night without catching anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets. When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to do what to tear. Verse seven, so they signal their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink from scarcity to abundance. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus's knees, go away from me Lord, he said, for I am a sinful man, for he and his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken and saw where his partners James and John. This morning, the Holy Spirit led me to talk about living a significant life. Tell you remember, living a significant life. Now there are three levels of living. Some people live at the level we call the survival level. They live at the level of survival. At survival level, that's the level of scarcity, that is the level where you just live by, not really escape. You want to see food for today. You're just looking at whether you're going to make it just today. If I can only make it today, if I can have food on my table today, if I can have school fees for my kids, if I can only have a car to drive, if I can only have an accommodation just to live by, that's a level of scarcity. But I have good news for you. Jesus did not come that you might live at the level of you are not living at survival. He said, the devil comes to steal, to kill and destroy. But I came that I might have life and life in its abundance. Many times we find our life living at that level of survival. We just live by. If only I can survive. But God has not created you to just live at a survival level. That is not your place. Tell your neighbor, that is not your place. Then other people go beyond the survival level and they reach a point of success. A point of success is an abundance level. It's a level where you have options. You know, no longer say, I wish I can have food today. You actually wonder what you're going to eat because you have a lot of options in your life. You are not wondering what you're going to put on because your wardrobe is so full that you take a lot of time. You actually start becoming late to church, not because you didn't have something to put on, because you are looking for which one. Blue yellow purple white red duct tape. You are just stuck at that level. And level of so many options. A success level. And listen, that's a good level. But again, that is not where you're called to stay. It's just good, but that's not where you're called to stay. And then beyond survival and beyond success, God is calling you to a level we call a significant level, a level of significance. Significance in my view is a place where your life is not all-rebellially living. You are not living to survive. You're not living just to enjoy success, but you're living to serve others and to bring glory to your Maker. Two things. You're living to serve others and to bring glory to your Maker. And that's why one man asked Jesus what can I do to do everything that you have called us to do to all of the hollow. And He said, do this one thing. Love the Lord with all your heart, with all your strength and with all your mind. That is what we call worship. Did you know that worship? It is not just a song. Singing is one way of expressing our worship, but that's not all worship is about. Worship is more than a song. Worship is anything that I do to show my father how much I revive him, how much I love him, how much I honor him. Anything that I do to express my devotion, my love, my honor, my reverence to the Lord, that is an act of worship. So we don't only worship on the stage on Sunday, every moment you breathe, you have an opportunity to demonstrate to God how much you honor him, how much you love him, how much you revive him at your place of work in your home, at your school, in your business, as you drive every opportunity is an opportunity to worship. Did you know even this morning when you chose to come to church, it was an act of worship. Some of you had voices that were telling you all this week you were so tired, you had so much just stay in and sleep a little bit. And you said no bed, I will have you another time, I have to go to worship my maker. That is an act of worship. You sacrifice your sleep because you want to come and glorify your God. It's an act of worship. Listen, when you open that envelope and you put in an offering, it's an act of worship. Every moment a temptation comes and tells you to do something that is sinful and you say no, that's an act of worship. So Jesus said, love the Lord your God with all your heart on your mind and then love your neighbor as yourself. And that is what that's what we call ministry. Leave to serve others. So when we love the Lord, our God with all our heart. And then we love others. That's the level of significance. Amen. That is the level of significance. It is where I live to honor. To honor the Lord God with all my strength and mind. I serve others as well as glorify God. But does the Lord, does the devil want you to reach that level? No. He wants you just to stay at the level of survival. If I, you work 365 days just to survive. You're working all about me, myself and I. If I can't only live by, if I, it's all about you. That's where the devil wants us to live. But that's not what you are created for. You are not created to live for yourself. Someone exalted us that we are born with our hands, our fists, you know? But you don't have to die this way. Just do this. Just do this. Amen. So we have to know that we are not born to live in a survival level. And how do we live in life? Listen to this. There is a difference between popularity and significance. Do you know that? Sometimes we see people who are famous and we think that they are significant. There is a difference between popularity and significance. Now let me show you an example. My palm, my hand is so popular. It has shaken many hands. Everybody knows your, you've shaken many hands, isn't it? How many of you have, how many, how many have seen your heart? Nobody has ever seen your heart. Even yourself, you've never seen your heart. I mean the real heart, not the spiritual heart. I mean the palm, but that palms are blood. Nobody, it is not so popular. But listen, you can get, you can lose this palm and you still live, but you can't lose your heart and still live. So that is how important significance is of a popularity. The fact that something is popular, it doesn't mean it is significant. Your palm is popular, but your heart is significant. Some people have been so worried because they are not so popular. You are not going to look for popularity and fame. You are called to live a significant life. Be faithful to doing what God has called you to do. At the right time He wants you to do. And that's all. And live the rest to Him. Now, we are coming back to the story of Peter, Simon Peter. This is a man. He had gone fishing. All his life, he had lived by the left side. And all his portion of work, he was a fish shaman, an experienced fish fish shaman. And one night he worked so hard. The whole night he toilet the whole night. He implemented every technique of fishing. And he made sure he did it at the right time. For fishermen they know you can best catch the fish well at night. And so he did it at the right time, night time, and he used all the techniques and all the vessels he had his boats. And he had his nets. He had done everything possible. But listen, by the end of the night he had called how much? Nothing. He had called nothing. And he had done everything. Is there someone in this room who identifies himself or has self with the Peter? You know you've done everything over a number of years. You've done every technique to succeed. You've done everything you think that it requires, but you have not seen results. That was the time where he was. And at the end of the whole night Peter got out and he got to start washing his nets. He was washing his nets. The fishermen used to wash their nets, getting ready for tomorrow. You know, he was like, today I didn't catch anything. Let me just wash my nets. Washing the net was a sign I'm done with today. And I'm done today in a disappointing manner. The member Peter was one of the elder disciples because he had a family, he had a wife, he had a family. Because one day the Bible tells us Jesus went to visit Peter and the Bible says his mother-in-law was sick. So he had the mother-in-law and the mother-in-law was nearby. Imagine a businessman who's going to go home with nothing and your mother-in-law is at home. Eferia, you rather failed without the mother-in-law at home. I'm speaking like someone who comes from Africa. I don't know about here, but I just tried to think about what Peter was going through. Very disappointed. And he was like, this is the way I'm going to go home. He had become bitter, disappointed, angry, and he's busy washing what? His nays. And he had left the boats over the other side. And all of a sudden Jesus came. Jesus came. And the Bible says when Jesus came by the next side, the Bible says there were crowds that were pressing so hard, desiring to hear the word of God. Was Peter also desiring us that much? No. Not motivated. Disappointed. Peter, just washing what? The nets. He didn't care about what Jesus is doing. He's just disappointed. And Jesus, the crowds around him, they're pressing so hard they want to hear the word of God. And when Jesus arrived at the sea shore, when he reached by the next side, he saw how many boats? Two boats. And when he saw the two boats, guess what? The Bible says Jesus came between the two boats, Jesus chose one. Which one did he choose? Simon's boat. Was Simon really very welcoming, attractive? No. And you know what? Jesus knew the struggles of Simon. Jesus knew the struggles of Simon. Tell your name, but Jesus knows your struggles. He knows your struggles. He knows your disappointments. He knows your worries. He knows your anxiety. He knows what you're going through. He really understands. And Jesus comes into that boat. And he chose the boat of Simon. And now he wanted Simon to take part in his getting into his boat. You know what he did? He told Simon, would you come and push me a little bit? I just want to be comfortable and meet the needs of these people. Now, this takes me to the few points. I want to share this morning, as we talk about living a significant life. Number one point is you need to acknowledge the grace of God upon your life. Acknowledge the grace of God. For those who are on the media, please keep on flowing with me. You know that's not a slide about that point. You need to know the grace of God upon your life. Acknowledge the grace of God upon your life. Why am I talking about the grace? When Jesus was at this lake, every other person was pressing hard. They wanted to hear the word of God. But Peter wasn't. He wasn't excited. He didn't even know what Jesus offers. He didn't know about what he could do in his life. He was not really interested. He was busy washing his needs. When Jesus came by the sea shore or by the lakeside, there were how many boats. There were two boats. But Jesus chose the boat of Simon Peter. How would you categorize that? That is the work of grace. Grace is the animated favor. A man who was not interested, but Jesus is running after him. I want to tell each one seated in this room. You are here because the grace of God located you. The grace of God located you. You were located. It's new way to find you. It found you. This man who was not interested at all, Jesus is coming looking for him. Have you lived so many years? There were so many who would have loved to be where you are. They are known that is the grace of God. There are two boats, but just chose that one. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And when we read the book of Luke 4 verse 25 to 27, and for those who are following on the screen, they would see that. The Bible says, certainly, there are many who are where how many? Many needy widows in Israel at the largest time when the heavens were closed for how many years, three and a half years, and the severe famine devastated the land. Verse 26, yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner, a widow of Zelfat in the land of Sidon. That is what we call grace. A foreigner was located by grace. A widow was located by grace. Not because you could do a lot of lobbying, but by grace. And he was sent instead to a foreigner. Verse 27, and many in Israel had leprosy in the time of Prophet Elijah, but the only one who healed was who? Naman is Sidon. I just want you to understand that you are born again by the grace of God. You are saved by the grace of God. And you are going to be enabled in the work of Christanity by the grace of God. You will succeed by the grace of God. You will prosper by the grace of God. You will live long by the grace of God. You shall not die, but live to program His wonders by the grace of God. The grace of God is upon your life. This man called Peter. The grace located him and said, please, would you come and push me? I have this chosen your boat. Why? Because Jesus would see Peter and see a great apostle. But for him, you could see a hustler who has failed in life. Someone that even the mother knows is going to say, what kind of man are you? But Jesus is seeing a champion of faith, a man who's going to be a generational change. I don't know where you are right now. Maybe you are at the left side. Maybe things have not gone right. You've tried at the best time, but nothing has come out. I have good news for you. Grace is locating you in Jesus' mighty name. Grace is locating where you are. And you know, we are a product of that grace. And Paul said in the first Corinthians, the book of first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 10, in the new living translation, it says, but whenever I am now, it is all because God poured out His special favor on me and not without results. I have worked harder than any of the other apostles yet. It was not I, but God was working through me by His grace. In the English standard version, the Bible says, but by the grace of God, I am what? I am. And His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is within me. Will you acknowledge God's grace in your life? You know, some people when they see they are appalling professionally, they start to say, you know what? In our DNA, from my great-grandfather, we are smart men. We are really smart. That's why you see I'm here. Listen, it is not because of your great-grandfather. Peter was so smart at fishing. He had done it at the right time, but things were not working out until Grace located him. Have you lived long enough in your healthy and strong? Some people say, you know, I have these disciplines from the time I was 15. I used to do jogging. I used to do pushups. Good, thank you. That's good practice, but many have been doing jogging, and they die this premature. The fact that you have lived this long enough, it is not you by the grace of God. Some people when their companies are growing, their businesses are growing, they say, you know, this thing of business flow is in my blood. It's not about the business flowing in your blood. It is by the grace of God. Amazing grace, amazing grace, amazing grace. So with me, I'm who I am, and I'm what I am by the grace of God. You know what the grace does? It takes away every reason of boasting in ourselves, and we boast in the Lord, and we boast in the Lord. Our church spent three years closed down, three years. During COVID, we closed for two years, and then one extra year, we still kept closing, and every church was open, ours was closed. And I was like, how can we, what are we going to do? We try to look for all holes to get to, we cannot get holes to gather in because we didn't have our own church building. So we are renting, and after COVID, they said, no renting anymore. So we stopped, and we had nowhere to go. We did zoom gatherings, and people were fed up of zoom, and you could only see 15 people turning up. I was like, how are we going to do? We tried everything possible, and all doors were locked. We even reached a point of leasing some buildings. We give money, and we don't end up not having the building, and the money is taken. Two times, and right in that middle of confusion, the middle of nowhere, the Lord told me, you need to start building your own building. I was like, how can we build when we are not gathering for three years? How can we start building when we are not meeting? How are we going to do fundraising, and the Lord reminded me? Do you remember when I told the Israelites that they are going to cross the Jordan? Did they reach on the Jordan? How was it? The Bible says it was flooding. It was flooding times. But when it was flooding, did they cross? Yes, I made a way in the flooding Jordan. I am a God who makes a way where it seems to be no way. This might be seeming, it might be seeming as a flood time in your life, but it is the best time for God to work. So guess what? We trusted in what God said, and we began by faith in the Lord. And you know what? By the grace of God. In one year, the building was finished. The building that sits 2,000 people was finished in one year when people were not physically meeting. How would I boast that it's about the bigger number that we have? It's about the pockets we have no. It is by the grace of God. By the grace of God. And harvest, church. I am sure I'm going to choose that I come in this season. That church you are building, it is going to be finished and completed in the shortest time possible by the grace of God. Hallelujah! It's not about the numbers. It's about the big God that we solve. Let's walk in the grace of God. The grace of God. The grace of God does great things that we can't do. But number two, if we're going to live a significant life, we have to respond to this grace by surrendering our boats. Amen? Peter was located by grace. Peter was located by grace. He didn't was not really touched, he was not moved by Jesus but just chose his boat. And now, Jesus did what? He said he chose to sit in his boat. But many times when we are going through tough times, we become hungry and we become bitter. And when anyone wants to touch our boats, they will see our wrath. They will know that we are really men. How do you joke with my boats when I have been struggling the whole night? Do you know my struggles? Do you know what I'm going through? Do you know how much I've been suffering? Do you know how much I've invested? This was Peter's investment. This was his way we had put much in this boat and Jesus comes from nowhere and he's sitting in his boat. Thank God for Peter. Though he was disappointed, though he had caught nothing, he surrendered his boats to Jesus. Do you know why Jesus wanted to sit in the boat? There were so many people, there were crowds pressing hard wanting to hear the word of God. And Jesus wanted to minister to others. And that's why I'm telling you a significant life is a life that goes beyond survival and goes beyond success and goes to a point where their lives are there to serve others. So now, Peter's boat is going to serve other people when he's struggling. Listen, he doesn't know what he's going to put on the table in his home, but his boat is going to serve the crowds for Jesus to preach. There are many times we want our needs to be made fast. And then Jesus' needs will be made later. That is vice versa. The Bible says in Matthew 6.33, seek fast the kingdom of God and His righteousness. And then the rest shall be added unto you. What comes fast? The kingdom fast. So this moment, Peter was struggling, but Jesus wanted to meet the kingdom needs. And Peter was like, though I am struggling, though I have nothing to feed my children, though I don't have what to take home with me. But Jesus, please have the boat and serve the crowds. Now, we're being told about building the church in some of us who are like, I'm still trying to get a mortgage from my own house. I still want to upgrade my car. I still want to upgrade my iPod. I still want to upgrade. You know, when I came to this country, I came with a Samsung. And the cousin brother called Marvin, the one who said, you had to say, I love you, he said, Uncle, if you have no iPod, you have nothing. You have no iPhone. Everything should be about I and I and I, you know. And when I had no network, he said, you know why? Because you don't have an iPhone. So I know in the US, people are always upgrading from I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8, I710. And now you are still gathering yourself to get an I7, and Jesus needs to meet the needs of the crowd. Remember that church building is not meant for a person. It is for a crowd to be blessed, to be saved. So when you choose to say, you know, I am like Simon, I've been struggling the whole night and I've not called anything, but Jesus needs to meet the needs of crowds. And I choose to let my boat be used for that. He allowed his boat. And to him, the boat was his investment. The boat was his business. The boat was his asset. The boat was his treasure. What is your boat? Probably for you, it is your gifts. You have gifts that need to be saved to save others, but you're sitting with your gifts. You're sitting with your talents. You're sitting with your resources. You're sitting with your everything about you. You're just sitting with it. It's time to let it solve. Let it solve. Don't wait for your success time. Just solve from obedience. Amen. Amen. So he had needs. You know that our needs are endless. He was wondering. But even in his struggles, in his struggles, he led his boat to you be used. Tell your neighbor, release your boat. Tell your neighbor, let Jesus use your boat. Some of you have voices and your voices are boats and you're seated in there and your voice is supposed to be serving in the choir. Some of you have a gift of hospitality and you're just sitting and you're never used. That gift of hospitality. Some of you, your boat is your time. You need to give more time to the Lord. Some of you, it is your energy. Some of you, it is your business. Some of you, it is your money. Some of you, it is, I don't know what God is telling you right now, but there is a boat that you have. You have something to that of that widow when Jesus was in the temple and the asked people to give that widow. Her boat was that small coin that widow's might. That was the boat she had and though she was struggling, she brought it out. What is your boat? Maybe your boat is your profession, your career. You have skills in IT. You have skills in media. You have skills in engineering. You have skills in structure engineering. Maybe that's your boat. You are still looking at this, taking care of you up to your old age, but God sees it as a boat that he can serve crowds and the needs, not only of the nation but of the world. We only need your boat. When grace finds you, you have to respond by surrendering your boat. And Mary, the mother of Jesus, when the angel found him in Luke chapter 1, verse 8 to 38, and 38, the Bible says, and he came to her and said, greetings of favorite one. The Lord is with you. And you know 38 what he says and Mary said, behold, I am the servant of the Lord. Let's be to me according to your word. And this angel departed from her. When grace found her and the favor found her, she leased her boat. And you know what her boat was? Her dreams. This was a young lady, a virgin. She had a dream of a wonderful wedding, white wedding. One day when they'll be taking her down the aisle, together with her dad and the moms are behind and the relatives and the cousin sisters. And if everybody's seated, she had a dream wedding. And the Lord comes in. I want to this to this taught every dream you had for the glory of his name and for the benefit of humanity. And then she had to let go of her dreams. But her life achieved more than she could achieve on her own. Number three, get to know that whatever we surrender to God is empowered to do exploits. Whatever we surrender to God, we see that Simon's boat and nets had not caught anything even in the most suitable time. When Simon willingly surrender them to Jesus are the command of Jesus. They became profitable, fruitful, impactful and significant. The same nets that caught nothing. The same boat that caught nothing. When he surrendered to Jesus, it became different. When you surrender your life, your gifts to Jesus, he will do exploits with them. When you surrender your talents to him, he will do marvelous things with them. What is your boat then? That needs us, needs to use and serve his purpose fast. To Simon, it was a boat, which was possession and investment, business and asset, a resource. What is it that Jesus requires you to surrender for his use? Is it your gifts? Is it time? Is it money? Is it an asset? Release it obediently. It won't be a West. Listen, it won't be a West. It will be more productive in his hands. It will be more productive in his hands. Simon's boat called a large number, not on a large but big fish, selected size. Just read it. They will tell you many hundreds but also on a big size. Why? He surrendered his boat to the Lord to serve his purpose fast. It is no secret what the Lord can do with your life. What you can do with your boat, with your gifts, if you surrender to them, surrender to them. What are you holding on to? Is it yourself? You have failed to release yourself in his hands. Listen, you will never die. Once you release your life in his hands. As I finish number four, beyond the boat, Jesus wants you to surrender your life. Simon started by surrendering his boat, but finally the Bible tells us he left everything and followed him. Listen to what happened when Jesus said, take up your boat, get your nets, go back for a catch, he called so much fish. And the Bible says almost their boats were sinking and their nets were going to tear apart. So he called for others to come and partner with them and they brought all the fish at the shore. When they reached at the shore, what happened? Peter looked at all this. He said, I am so sinful. He acknowledged the grace of God and said, know what, if we can do this with my boat, if we can turn this useless boat and this useless net into such fruitful assets, what can he do with my life? Now it's no trouble about the boat. I surrender my life to you, Jesus, and I've decided to do what to follow you. If you sit in this room, I want to let you know, if you're never given your life to Jesus, just know the best thing you can ever do is to surrender your life to Jesus. We begin by giving our boats, begin by giving our gifts, begin by giving our position, but we end up giving our whole life. And by the way, you can never say that you love God with all your heart if you don't love him with your resources. The Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 6, verse 21, for where your treasure is, there your heart will also be. You can't sing to the Lord that I love you with all my heart, but not with all my pocket, with all my heart, not with all my bank account, with all my heart, but not with all my time, with all my heart, but not with all my passion. No, no, no, no. We give him whatever we have, but we end up giving him our souls. So a significant life is a life beyond survival, a life beyond success. It's a life that serves others and brings glory to God. And the John 17 verse 4 says, when Jesus was finishing his mission, this is what said, Father, I glorified you on the earth because I finished the work you gave me to do. I pray that you won't be in this rat race of trying to win people's appraisal, people's acceptance, and to be popular, to be famous, sick, to be faithful. Keep serving and that's all he wants from you. Faithfully serve and let your life serve God and serve his people and bring glory to his holy name. May our request as to stand on our feet and pray. Prayer that the Holy Spirit, he knows how to do his way. This moment I want you to take just a few seconds and acknowledge his grace upon your life. You are alive today because of his grace. How sweet sounds that say, the rest is lost, I see. Take a moment and thank God for his grace upon your life. Speak out to him and say thank you. I acknowledge his grace in your life, in your family, in your children, in your businesses, in your life. He has been so good. He's been so good. He protected you. This fire has brought you. It is because of his grace. He have found you when you are like Simon Samoa, when things were not working out, when those were not connecting, he found you. He found you. He found you. Grace located you. Grace located you. Grace located you. You are who you are and what you are. Just may I kindly request that you hold the shoulder of your neighbor on the right and on your left. Hold the shoulder of your neighbor on the right and on your left if you can please. You don't know what that person is going through. We're going to pray for one another. Pray for them. Probably their way Simon was at that moment, but pray for them as the Holy Spirit leads you. Pray for them. Pray for them. Go ahead and pray. Go ahead and pray. Every father, we thank you for this great morning. Thank you for your grace that locates us wherever we are. When we think nobody knows what we are going through you know and you locate us Lord. My father, because of that amazing grace, enable us Lord to surrender, to respond by surrender. All that you want us to surrender to you. And I pray that your Holy Spirit will speak to each one because we know that he's good at that. In Jesus' name, I ask and pray. Amen.

**[04:34 - 04:44]** wonderful work. Now this morning as I was I mean, not this morning when I was given the chance

**[04:44 - 04:53]** the opportunity to say to share the word of God, I prayed about it. And I like it so much when

**[04:53 - 04:59]** I'm told that let the Holy Spirit lead you. And that's what actually Bishop said. Just do as the

**[04:59 - 05:05]** Holy Spirit leads you. Are you ready to receive the Holy Spirit administration this morning?

**[05:08 - 05:14]** So our study this morning is going to be based in the book of Luke chapter one from verse

**[05:14 - 05:20]** chapter five, sorry, from for the first verse to the foot to the fourth verse. Look chapter five,

**[05:20 - 05:29]** verse one to four. And the Bible reads, I'll be reading from the new leading translation. It says on

**[05:29 - 05:37]** one occasion while Jesus was standing by the leg of Genesareta with the crowd pressing in on him

**[05:37 - 05:44]** to hear the word of God. He saw two boats, how many boats? Two boats at the age of the leg.

**[05:45 - 05:53]** The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. Jesus got into the boat belonging to

**[05:53 - 06:03]** who? To Simon and asked him to put out a little from the shore and sitting down. He taught the

**[06:03 - 06:12]** people from the boat. When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, put out into deep water

**[06:12 - 06:20]** and let down your nets for recouch. They are heavily fathered this morning as we share this

**[06:20 - 06:26]** what I pray that your Holy Spirit will be moving in this room. May the Holy Spirit bring

**[06:26 - 06:34]** reveration and breathe upon every spoken word to bring life. Your word says the entrance

**[06:34 - 06:40]** of your word, the reveration of your word brings light, let that light shine in every heart

**[06:40 - 06:49]** in Jesus name. Amen. Verse five, it says, Master Simon replied, we have worked hard all night

**[06:49 - 06:58]** without catching anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets. When they had done so,

**[06:58 - 07:08]** they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to do what to tear. Verse seven, so they

**[07:10 - 07:16]** signal their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats

**[07:16 - 07:26]** so full that they began to sink from scarcity to abundance. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell

**[07:26 - 07:33]** at Jesus's knees, go away from me Lord, he said, for I am a sinful man, for he and his companions

**[07:33 - 07:41]** were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken and saw where his partners James and John.

**[07:42 - 07:48]** This morning, the Holy Spirit led me to talk about living a significant life. Tell you

**[07:48 - 07:58]** remember, living a significant life. Now there are three levels of living. Some people live at the

**[07:58 - 08:06]** level we call the survival level. They live at the level of survival. At survival level, that's the

**[08:06 - 08:13]** level of scarcity, that is the level where you just live by, not really escape. You want to see

**[08:13 - 08:19]** food for today. You're just looking at whether you're going to make it just today. If I can only make

**[08:19 - 08:24]** it today, if I can have food on my table today, if I can have school fees for my kids, if I can only

**[08:24 - 08:32]** have a car to drive, if I can only have an accommodation just to live by, that's a level of scarcity.

**[08:34 - 08:40]** But I have good news for you. Jesus did not come that you might live at the level of

**[08:43 - 08:49]** you are not living at survival. He said, the devil comes to steal, to kill and destroy. But I

**[08:49 - 09:00]** came that I might have life and life in its abundance. Many times we find our life living at that

**[09:00 - 09:09]** level of survival. We just live by. If only I can survive. But God has not created you to just

**[09:09 - 09:16]** live at a survival level. That is not your place. Tell your neighbor, that is not your place.

**[09:19 - 09:26]** Then other people go beyond the survival level and they reach a point of success. A point of

**[09:26 - 09:32]** success is an abundance level. It's a level where you have options. You know, no longer say, I wish I

**[09:32 - 09:38]** can have food today. You actually wonder what you're going to eat because you have a lot of options

**[09:38 - 09:44]** in your life. You are not wondering what you're going to put on because your wardrobe is so full

**[09:44 - 09:49]** that you take a lot of time. You actually start becoming late to church, not because you didn't have

**[09:49 - 09:54]** something to put on, because you are looking for which one. Blue yellow purple white red duct tape.

**[09:57 - 10:05]** You are just stuck at that level. And level of so many options. A success level. And listen,

**[10:05 - 10:09]** that's a good level. But again, that is not where you're called to stay.

**[10:11 - 10:21]** It's just good, but that's not where you're called to stay. And then beyond survival and beyond

**[10:21 - 10:28]** success, God is calling you to a level we call a significant level, a level of significance.

**[10:29 - 10:37]** Significance in my view is a place where your life is not all-rebellially living. You are not

**[10:37 - 10:43]** living to survive. You're not living just to enjoy success, but you're living to serve others

**[10:43 - 10:50]** and to bring glory to your Maker. Two things. You're living to serve others and to bring glory to

**[10:50 - 10:56]** your Maker. And that's why one man asked Jesus what can I do to do everything that you have

**[10:56 - 11:01]** called us to do to all of the hollow. And He said, do this one thing. Love the Lord with all your

**[11:01 - 11:08]** heart, with all your strength and with all your mind. That is what we call worship. Did you know

**[11:08 - 11:14]** that worship? It is not just a song. Singing is one way of expressing our worship, but that's not

**[11:14 - 11:25]** all worship is about. Worship is more than a song. Worship is anything that I do to show my father

**[11:25 - 11:32]** how much I revive him, how much I love him, how much I honor him. Anything that I do to express my

**[11:32 - 11:42]** devotion, my love, my honor, my reverence to the Lord, that is an act of worship. So we don't only

**[11:42 - 11:49]** worship on the stage on Sunday, every moment you breathe, you have an opportunity to demonstrate to

**[11:49 - 11:56]** God how much you honor him, how much you love him, how much you revive him at your place of work

**[11:56 - 12:03]** in your home, at your school, in your business, as you drive every opportunity is an opportunity

**[12:03 - 12:11]** to worship. Did you know even this morning when you chose to come to church, it was an act of

**[12:11 - 12:18]** worship. Some of you had voices that were telling you all this week you were so tired, you had so much

**[12:19 - 12:24]** just stay in and sleep a little bit. And you said no bed, I will have you another time,

**[12:24 - 12:30]** I have to go to worship my maker. That is an act of worship. You sacrifice your sleep because you

**[12:30 - 12:38]** want to come and glorify your God. It's an act of worship. Listen, when you open that envelope and

**[12:38 - 12:47]** you put in an offering, it's an act of worship. Every moment a temptation comes and tells you to do

**[12:47 - 12:55]** something that is sinful and you say no, that's an act of worship. So Jesus said, love the Lord

**[12:55 - 13:03]** your God with all your heart on your mind and then love your neighbor as yourself. And that is

**[13:03 - 13:11]** what that's what we call ministry. Leave to serve others. So when we love the Lord, our God with all

**[13:11 - 13:19]** our heart. And then we love others. That's the level of significance. Amen. That is the level

**[13:19 - 13:25]** of significance. It is where I live to honor. To honor the Lord God with all my strength and mind.

**[13:25 - 13:31]** I serve others as well as glorify God. But does the Lord, does the devil want you to reach that

**[13:31 - 13:40]** level? No. He wants you just to stay at the level of survival. If I, you work 365 days just to survive.

**[13:40 - 13:46]** You're working all about me, myself and I. If I can't only live by, if I, it's all about you.

**[13:46 - 13:51]** That's where the devil wants us to live. But that's not what you are created for. You are not

**[13:51 - 13:57]** created to live for yourself. Someone exalted us that we are born with our hands, our fists, you know?

**[13:58 - 14:06]** But you don't have to die this way. Just do this. Just do this. Amen. So we have to know that we are

**[14:06 - 14:13]** not born to live in a survival level. And how do we live in life? Listen to this. There is a

**[14:13 - 14:22]** difference between popularity and significance. Do you know that? Sometimes we see people who are

**[14:22 - 14:28]** famous and we think that they are significant. There is a difference between popularity and

**[14:28 - 14:34]** significance. Now let me show you an example. My palm, my hand is so popular. It has shaken many

**[14:34 - 14:42]** hands. Everybody knows your, you've shaken many hands, isn't it? How many of you have, how many,

**[14:42 - 14:48]** how many have seen your heart? Nobody has ever seen your heart. Even yourself, you've never seen

**[14:48 - 14:53]** your heart. I mean the real heart, not the spiritual heart. I mean the palm, but that palms are

**[14:53 - 14:59]** blood. Nobody, it is not so popular. But listen, you can get, you can lose this palm and you

**[14:59 - 15:07]** still live, but you can't lose your heart and still live. So that is how important significance

**[15:07 - 15:15]** is of a popularity. The fact that something is popular, it doesn't mean it is significant.

**[15:18 - 15:26]** Your palm is popular, but your heart is significant. Some people have been so worried because

**[15:26 - 15:32]** they are not so popular. You are not going to look for popularity and fame. You are called to live

**[15:32 - 15:40]** a significant life. Be faithful to doing what God has called you to do. At the right time He wants

**[15:40 - 15:53]** you to do. And that's all. And live the rest to Him. Now, we are coming back to the story of

**[15:53 - 16:00]** Peter, Simon Peter. This is a man. He had gone fishing. All his life, he had lived by the

**[16:00 - 16:06]** left side. And all his portion of work, he was a fish shaman, an experienced fish fish shaman.

**[16:06 - 16:16]** And one night he worked so hard. The whole night he toilet the whole night. He implemented

**[16:16 - 16:23]** every technique of fishing. And he made sure he did it at the right time. For fishermen they know

**[16:23 - 16:30]** you can best catch the fish well at night. And so he did it at the right time, night time,

**[16:30 - 16:36]** and he used all the techniques and all the vessels he had his boats. And he had his nets. He had done

**[16:36 - 16:42]** everything possible. But listen, by the end of the night he had called how much? Nothing.

**[16:43 - 16:51]** He had called nothing. And he had done everything. Is there someone in this room who identifies

**[16:51 - 16:57]** himself or has self with the Peter? You know you've done everything over a number of years.

**[16:57 - 17:03]** You've done every technique to succeed. You've done everything you think that it requires,

**[17:03 - 17:09]** but you have not seen results. That was the time where he was. And at the end of the whole night

**[17:09 - 17:17]** Peter got out and he got to start washing his nets. He was washing his nets. The fishermen used to

**[17:17 - 17:23]** wash their nets, getting ready for tomorrow. You know, he was like, today I didn't catch anything.

**[17:23 - 17:30]** Let me just wash my nets. Washing the net was a sign I'm done with today. And I'm done today

**[17:30 - 17:36]** in a disappointing manner. The member Peter was one of the elder disciples because he had a family,

**[17:36 - 17:43]** he had a wife, he had a family. Because one day the Bible tells us Jesus went to visit Peter

**[17:43 - 17:48]** and the Bible says his mother-in-law was sick. So he had the mother-in-law and the mother-in-law was

**[17:48 - 17:54]** nearby. Imagine a businessman who's going to go home with nothing and your mother-in-law is at home.

**[17:57 - 18:04]** Eferia, you rather failed without the mother-in-law at home. I'm speaking like someone who comes from Africa.

**[18:06 - 18:11]** I don't know about here, but I just tried to think about what Peter was going through.

**[18:12 - 18:19]** Very disappointed. And he was like, this is the way I'm going to go home. He had become bitter,

**[18:20 - 18:27]** disappointed, angry, and he's busy washing what? His nays. And he had left the boats

**[18:27 - 18:37]** over the other side. And all of a sudden Jesus came. Jesus came. And the Bible says when Jesus came

**[18:37 - 18:44]** by the next side, the Bible says there were crowds that were pressing so hard, desiring to hear the

**[18:44 - 18:54]** word of God. Was Peter also desiring us that much? No. Not motivated. Disappointed.

**[18:54 - 19:01]** Peter, just washing what? The nets. He didn't care about what Jesus is doing. He's just

**[19:01 - 19:10]** disappointed. And Jesus, the crowds around him, they're pressing so hard they want to hear the

**[19:10 - 19:16]** word of God. And when Jesus arrived at the sea shore, when he reached by the next side,

**[19:16 - 19:24]** he saw how many boats? Two boats. And when he saw the two boats, guess what? The Bible says Jesus came

**[19:27 - 19:34]** between the two boats, Jesus chose one. Which one did he choose? Simon's boat.

**[19:37 - 19:45]** Was Simon really very welcoming, attractive? No. And you know what? Jesus knew the struggles of Simon.

**[19:47 - 19:54]** Jesus knew the struggles of Simon. Tell your name, but Jesus knows your struggles. He knows your

**[19:54 - 20:02]** struggles. He knows your disappointments. He knows your worries. He knows your anxiety. He knows

**[20:02 - 20:09]** what you're going through. He really understands. And Jesus comes into that boat. And he

**[20:09 - 20:17]** chose the boat of Simon. And now he wanted Simon to take part in his getting into his boat.

**[20:17 - 20:23]** You know what he did? He told Simon, would you come and push me a little bit? I just want

**[20:23 - 20:31]** to be comfortable and meet the needs of these people. Now, this takes me to the few points. I want

**[20:31 - 20:38]** to share this morning, as we talk about living a significant life. Number one point is you need

**[20:38 - 20:46]** to acknowledge the grace of God upon your life. Acknowledge the grace of God. For those who are

**[20:46 - 20:52]** on the media, please keep on flowing with me. You know that's not a slide about that point. You need

**[20:52 - 20:59]** to know the grace of God upon your life. Acknowledge the grace of God upon your life. Why am I talking

**[20:59 - 21:08]** about the grace? When Jesus was at this lake, every other person was pressing hard. They wanted to

**[21:08 - 21:16]** hear the word of God. But Peter wasn't. He wasn't excited. He didn't even know what Jesus offers.

**[21:16 - 21:22]** He didn't know about what he could do in his life. He was not really interested. He was busy

**[21:22 - 21:28]** washing his needs. When Jesus came by the sea shore or by the lakeside, there were how many boats.

**[21:28 - 21:36]** There were two boats. But Jesus chose the boat of Simon Peter. How would you categorize that?

**[21:36 - 21:47]** That is the work of grace. Grace is the animated favor. A man who was not interested, but Jesus is

**[21:47 - 21:54]** running after him. I want to tell each one seated in this room. You are here because the grace of God

**[21:54 - 22:02]** located you. The grace of God located you. You were located. It's new way to find you. It found you.

**[22:04 - 22:13]** This man who was not interested at all, Jesus is coming looking for him. Have you lived so many years?

**[22:17 - 22:22]** There were so many who would have loved to be where you are. They are known that is the grace of God.

**[22:23 - 22:30]** There are two boats, but just chose that one. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

**[22:30 - 22:36]** And when we read the book of Luke 4 verse 25 to 27, and for those who are following on the screen,

**[22:36 - 22:43]** they would see that. The Bible says, certainly, there are many who are where how many? Many needy

**[22:43 - 22:49]** widows in Israel at the largest time when the heavens were closed for how many years, three and a

**[22:49 - 22:56]** half years, and the severe famine devastated the land. Verse 26, yet Elijah was not sent to any of

**[22:56 - 23:04]** them. He was sent instead to a foreigner, a widow of Zelfat in the land of Sidon. That is what we

**[23:04 - 23:13]** call grace. A foreigner was located by grace. A widow was located by grace. Not because you could

**[23:13 - 23:20]** do a lot of lobbying, but by grace. And he was sent instead to a foreigner. Verse 27, and many in

**[23:20 - 23:26]** Israel had leprosy in the time of Prophet Elijah, but the only one who healed was who? Naman is Sidon.

**[23:27 - 23:33]** I just want you to understand that you are born again by the grace of God. You are saved by the grace

**[23:33 - 23:39]** of God. And you are going to be enabled in the work of Christanity by the grace of God. You will

**[23:39 - 23:46]** succeed by the grace of God. You will prosper by the grace of God. You will live long by the grace

**[23:46 - 23:54]** of God. You shall not die, but live to program His wonders by the grace of God. The grace of God is

**[23:54 - 24:05]** upon your life. This man called Peter. The grace located him and said, please, would you come and

**[24:05 - 24:10]** push me? I have this chosen your boat. Why? Because Jesus would see Peter and see a great apostle.

**[24:12 - 24:17]** But for him, you could see a hustler who has failed in life. Someone that even the mother

**[24:17 - 24:24]** knows is going to say, what kind of man are you? But Jesus is seeing a champion of faith, a man

**[24:24 - 24:29]** who's going to be a generational change. I don't know where you are right now. Maybe you are at the

**[24:29 - 24:35]** left side. Maybe things have not gone right. You've tried at the best time, but nothing has come

**[24:35 - 24:43]** out. I have good news for you. Grace is locating you in Jesus' mighty name. Grace is locating where you are.

**[24:46 - 24:52]** And you know, we are a product of that grace. And Paul said in the first Corinthians, the book of

**[24:52 - 24:59]** first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 10, in the new living translation, it says, but whenever I am

**[24:59 - 25:08]** now, it is all because God poured out His special favor on me and not without results. I have

**[25:08 - 25:16]** worked harder than any of the other apostles yet. It was not I, but God was working through me by His

**[25:17 - 25:23]** grace. In the English standard version, the Bible says, but by the grace of God, I am what? I

**[25:23 - 25:32]** am. And His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,

**[25:32 - 25:43]** though it was not I, but the grace of God that is within me. Will you acknowledge God's grace in

**[25:43 - 25:50]** your life? You know, some people when they see they are appalling professionally, they start to

**[25:50 - 25:56]** say, you know what? In our DNA, from my great-grandfather, we are smart men. We are really smart. That's

**[25:56 - 26:03]** why you see I'm here. Listen, it is not because of your great-grandfather. Peter was so smart at

**[26:03 - 26:09]** fishing. He had done it at the right time, but things were not working out until Grace located

**[26:09 - 26:17]** him. Have you lived long enough in your healthy and strong? Some people say, you know, I have

**[26:17 - 26:22]** these disciplines from the time I was 15. I used to do jogging. I used to do pushups. Good,

**[26:22 - 26:27]** thank you. That's good practice, but many have been doing jogging, and they die this premature.

**[26:28 - 26:32]** The fact that you have lived this long enough, it is not you by the grace of God.

**[26:34 - 26:40]** Some people when their companies are growing, their businesses are growing, they say, you know,

**[26:40 - 26:46]** this thing of business flow is in my blood. It's not about the business flowing in your blood. It is

**[26:46 - 26:57]** by the grace of God. Amazing grace, amazing grace, amazing grace. So with me, I'm who I am,

**[26:58 - 27:07]** and I'm what I am by the grace of God. You know what the grace does? It takes away every reason of

**[27:07 - 27:18]** boasting in ourselves, and we boast in the Lord, and we boast in the Lord. Our church spent three

**[27:18 - 27:26]** years closed down, three years. During COVID, we closed for two years, and then one extra year,

**[27:26 - 27:32]** we still kept closing, and every church was open, ours was closed. And I was like, how can we,

**[27:33 - 27:38]** what are we going to do? We try to look for all holes to get to, we cannot get holes to gather

**[27:38 - 27:43]** in because we didn't have our own church building. So we are renting, and after COVID, they said,

**[27:43 - 27:50]** no renting anymore. So we stopped, and we had nowhere to go. We did zoom gatherings, and people

**[27:50 - 27:56]** were fed up of zoom, and you could only see 15 people turning up. I was like, how are we going to do?

**[27:56 - 28:02]** We tried everything possible, and all doors were locked. We even reached a point of leasing some

**[28:02 - 28:07]** buildings. We give money, and we don't end up not having the building, and the money is taken.

**[28:07 - 28:14]** Two times, and right in that middle of confusion, the middle of nowhere, the Lord told me,

**[28:14 - 28:20]** you need to start building your own building. I was like, how can we build when we are not gathering

**[28:20 - 28:27]** for three years? How can we start building when we are not meeting? How are we going to do fundraising,

**[28:27 - 28:31]** and the Lord reminded me? Do you remember when I told the Israelites that they are going to cross

**[28:31 - 28:37]** the Jordan? Did they reach on the Jordan? How was it? The Bible says it was flooding. It was

**[28:37 - 28:45]** flooding times. But when it was flooding, did they cross? Yes, I made a way in the flooding Jordan.

**[28:45 - 28:52]** I am a God who makes a way where it seems to be no way. This might be seeming, it might be seeming

**[28:52 - 28:58]** as a flood time in your life, but it is the best time for God to work. So guess what? We trusted

**[28:58 - 29:05]** in what God said, and we began by faith in the Lord. And you know what? By the grace of God.

**[29:05 - 29:15]** In one year, the building was finished. The building that sits 2,000 people was finished in one

**[29:15 - 29:21]** year when people were not physically meeting. How would I boast that it's about the bigger number

**[29:21 - 29:31]** that we have? It's about the pockets we have no. It is by the grace of God. By the grace of God.

**[29:31 - 29:37]** And harvest, church. I am sure I'm going to choose that I come in this season. That church you are

**[29:37 - 29:44]** building, it is going to be finished and completed in the shortest time possible by the grace of God.

**[29:45 - 29:57]** Hallelujah! It's not about the numbers. It's about the big God that we solve.

**[30:03 - 30:10]** Let's walk in the grace of God. The grace of God. The grace of God does great things that we can't

**[30:10 - 30:18]** do. But number two, if we're going to live a significant life, we have to respond to this grace

**[30:18 - 30:27]** by surrendering our boats. Amen? Peter was located by grace. Peter was located by grace.

**[30:28 - 30:35]** He didn't was not really touched, he was not moved by Jesus but just chose his boat. And now,

**[30:35 - 30:41]** Jesus did what? He said he chose to sit in his boat. But many times when we are going through tough

**[30:41 - 30:51]** times, we become hungry and we become bitter. And when anyone wants to touch our boats,

**[30:52 - 30:59]** they will see our wrath. They will know that we are really men. How do you joke with my boats

**[31:00 - 31:05]** when I have been struggling the whole night? Do you know my struggles? Do you know what I'm going

**[31:05 - 31:11]** through? Do you know how much I've been suffering? Do you know how much I've invested? This was

**[31:11 - 31:17]** Peter's investment. This was his way we had put much in this boat and Jesus comes from nowhere and

**[31:17 - 31:29]** he's sitting in his boat. Thank God for Peter. Though he was disappointed, though he had

**[31:29 - 31:37]** caught nothing, he surrendered his boats to Jesus. Do you know why Jesus wanted to sit in the boat?

**[31:38 - 31:43]** There were so many people, there were crowds pressing hard wanting to hear the word of God.

**[31:43 - 31:48]** And Jesus wanted to minister to others. And that's why I'm telling you a significant life is a

**[31:48 - 31:55]** life that goes beyond survival and goes beyond success and goes to a point where their lives are there

**[31:55 - 32:04]** to serve others. So now, Peter's boat is going to serve other people when he's struggling. Listen,

**[32:04 - 32:09]** he doesn't know what he's going to put on the table in his home, but his boat is going to

**[32:09 - 32:19]** serve the crowds for Jesus to preach. There are many times we want our needs to be made fast. And then

**[32:19 - 32:28]** Jesus' needs will be made later. That is vice versa. The Bible says in Matthew 6.33,

**[32:28 - 32:35]** seek fast the kingdom of God and His righteousness. And then the rest shall be added unto you.

**[32:35 - 32:44]** What comes fast? The kingdom fast. So this moment, Peter was struggling, but Jesus wanted to

**[32:44 - 32:50]** meet the kingdom needs. And Peter was like, though I am struggling, though I have nothing to

**[32:50 - 32:56]** feed my children, though I don't have what to take home with me. But Jesus, please have the boat

**[32:56 - 33:08]** and serve the crowds. Now, we're being told about building the church in some of us who are like, I'm

**[33:08 - 33:15]** still trying to get a mortgage from my own house. I still want to upgrade my car. I still want to

**[33:15 - 33:21]** upgrade my iPod. I still want to upgrade. You know, when I came to this country, I came with

**[33:21 - 33:27]** a Samsung. And the cousin brother called Marvin, the one who said, you had to say, I love you,

**[33:27 - 33:32]** he said, Uncle, if you have no iPod, you have nothing. You have no iPhone. Everything should be about

**[33:32 - 33:39]** I and I and I, you know. And when I had no network, he said, you know why? Because you don't have an

**[33:39 - 33:49]** iPhone. So I know in the US, people are always upgrading from I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8, I710.

**[33:52 - 33:58]** And now you are still gathering yourself to get an I7, and Jesus needs to meet the needs of the

**[33:58 - 34:06]** crowd. Remember that church building is not meant for a person. It is for a crowd to be blessed,

**[34:06 - 34:13]** to be saved. So when you choose to say, you know, I am like Simon, I've been struggling the whole

**[34:13 - 34:20]** night and I've not called anything, but Jesus needs to meet the needs of crowds. And I choose to

**[34:20 - 34:29]** let my boat be used for that. He allowed his boat. And to him, the boat was his investment. The boat

**[34:29 - 34:35]** was his business. The boat was his asset. The boat was his treasure. What is your boat?

**[34:36 - 34:42]** Probably for you, it is your gifts. You have gifts that need to be saved to save others,

**[34:42 - 34:46]** but you're sitting with your gifts. You're sitting with your talents. You're sitting with your

**[34:46 - 34:52]** resources. You're sitting with your everything about you. You're just sitting with it. It's time to

**[34:52 - 35:04]** let it solve. Let it solve. Don't wait for your success time. Just solve from obedience. Amen. Amen.

**[35:07 - 35:18]** So he had needs. You know that our needs are endless. He was wondering. But even in his struggles,

**[35:19 - 35:26]** in his struggles, he led his boat to you be used. Tell your neighbor, release your boat.

**[35:28 - 35:36]** Tell your neighbor, let Jesus use your boat. Some of you have voices and your voices are boats

**[35:36 - 35:40]** and you're seated in there and your voice is supposed to be serving in the choir.

**[35:41 - 35:47]** Some of you have a gift of hospitality and you're just sitting and you're never used.

**[35:47 - 35:54]** That gift of hospitality. Some of you, your boat is your time. You need to give more time to the

**[35:54 - 36:01]** Lord. Some of you, it is your energy. Some of you, it is your business. Some of you, it is your

**[36:01 - 36:06]** money. Some of you, it is, I don't know what God is telling you right now, but there is a boat

**[36:06 - 36:13]** that you have. You have something to that of that widow when Jesus was in the temple and the

**[36:13 - 36:20]** asked people to give that widow. Her boat was that small coin that widow's might. That was the boat

**[36:20 - 36:29]** she had and though she was struggling, she brought it out. What is your boat? Maybe your boat is

**[36:29 - 36:35]** your profession, your career. You have skills in IT. You have skills in media. You have skills in

**[36:35 - 36:40]** engineering. You have skills in structure engineering. Maybe that's your boat. You are still looking at

**[36:40 - 36:46]** this, taking care of you up to your old age, but God sees it as a boat that he can serve crowds

**[36:46 - 37:01]** and the needs, not only of the nation but of the world. We only need your boat. When grace

**[37:01 - 37:10]** finds you, you have to respond by surrendering your boat. And Mary, the mother of Jesus, when the

**[37:10 - 37:16]** angel found him in Luke chapter 1, verse 8 to 38, and 38, the Bible says, and he came to her and

**[37:16 - 37:23]** said, greetings of favorite one. The Lord is with you. And you know 38 what he says and Mary said,

**[37:23 - 37:30]** behold, I am the servant of the Lord. Let's be to me according to your word. And this angel departed

**[37:30 - 37:36]** from her. When grace found her and the favor found her, she leased her boat. And you know what her

**[37:36 - 37:43]** boat was? Her dreams. This was a young lady, a virgin. She had a dream of a wonderful wedding,

**[37:43 - 37:48]** white wedding. One day when they'll be taking her down the aisle, together with her dad and the

**[37:48 - 37:53]** moms are behind and the relatives and the cousin sisters. And if everybody's seated, she had a dream

**[37:53 - 37:59]** wedding. And the Lord comes in. I want to this to this taught every dream you had for the glory of

**[37:59 - 38:11]** his name and for the benefit of humanity. And then she had to let go of her dreams. But her life

**[38:11 - 38:18]** achieved more than she could achieve on her own. Number three, get to know that whatever

**[38:18 - 38:27]** we surrender to God is empowered to do exploits. Whatever we surrender to God, we see that

**[38:27 - 38:35]** Simon's boat and nets had not caught anything even in the most suitable time. When Simon willingly

**[38:35 - 38:41]** surrender them to Jesus are the command of Jesus. They became profitable, fruitful, impactful

**[38:41 - 38:50]** and significant. The same nets that caught nothing. The same boat that caught nothing. When he

**[38:50 - 38:58]** surrendered to Jesus, it became different. When you surrender your life, your gifts to Jesus,

**[38:59 - 39:05]** he will do exploits with them. When you surrender your talents to him, he will do marvelous things with

**[39:05 - 39:16]** them. What is your boat then? That needs us, needs to use and serve his purpose fast. To Simon, it was a

**[39:16 - 39:25]** boat, which was possession and investment, business and asset, a resource. What is it that Jesus

**[39:25 - 39:33]** requires you to surrender for his use? Is it your gifts? Is it time? Is it money? Is it an asset?

**[39:33 - 39:41]** Release it obediently. It won't be a West. Listen, it won't be a West. It will be more productive

**[39:41 - 39:50]** in his hands. It will be more productive in his hands. Simon's boat called a large number, not

**[39:50 - 40:00]** on a large but big fish, selected size. Just read it. They will tell you many hundreds but also

**[40:00 - 40:06]** on a big size. Why? He surrendered his boat to the Lord to serve his purpose fast.

**[40:08 - 40:16]** It is no secret what the Lord can do with your life. What you can do with your boat, with your gifts,

**[40:16 - 40:23]** if you surrender to them, surrender to them. What are you holding on to? Is it yourself? You have

**[40:23 - 40:29]** failed to release yourself in his hands. Listen, you will never die. Once you release your life

**[40:29 - 40:41]** in his hands. As I finish number four, beyond the boat, Jesus wants you to surrender your life.

**[40:42 - 40:50]** Simon started by surrendering his boat, but finally the Bible tells us he left everything and

**[40:50 - 40:59]** followed him. Listen to what happened when Jesus said, take up your boat, get your nets,

**[40:59 - 41:09]** go back for a catch, he called so much fish. And the Bible says almost their boats were sinking

**[41:09 - 41:14]** and their nets were going to tear apart. So he called for others to come and partner with them

**[41:14 - 41:21]** and they brought all the fish at the shore. When they reached at the shore, what happened? Peter looked

**[41:21 - 41:30]** at all this. He said, I am so sinful. He acknowledged the grace of God and said, know what,

**[41:30 - 41:39]** if we can do this with my boat, if we can turn this useless boat and this useless net into such

**[41:39 - 41:47]** fruitful assets, what can he do with my life? Now it's no trouble about the boat. I surrender my life

**[41:47 - 41:54]** to you, Jesus, and I've decided to do what to follow you. If you sit in this room, I want to

**[41:54 - 41:59]** let you know, if you're never given your life to Jesus, just know the best thing you can ever do

**[41:59 - 42:11]** is to surrender your life to Jesus. We begin by giving our boats, begin by giving our gifts,

**[42:11 - 42:18]** begin by giving our position, but we end up giving our whole life. And by the way, you can never

**[42:18 - 42:23]** say that you love God with all your heart if you don't love him with your resources. The Bible

**[42:23 - 42:30]** tells us in Matthew chapter 6, verse 21, for where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.

**[42:31 - 42:36]** You can't sing to the Lord that I love you with all my heart, but not with all my pocket,

**[42:37 - 42:43]** with all my heart, not with all my bank account, with all my heart, but not with all my time,

**[42:43 - 42:52]** with all my heart, but not with all my passion. No, no, no, no. We give him whatever we have,

**[42:52 - 43:01]** but we end up giving him our souls. So a significant life is a life beyond survival, a life beyond

**[43:01 - 43:09]** success. It's a life that serves others and brings glory to God. And the John 17 verse 4 says,

**[43:09 - 43:15]** when Jesus was finishing his mission, this is what said, Father, I glorified you on the earth

**[43:15 - 43:24]** because I finished the work you gave me to do. I pray that you won't be in this rat race of trying

**[43:24 - 43:32]** to win people's appraisal, people's acceptance, and to be popular, to be famous, sick, to be faithful.

**[43:33 - 43:40]** Keep serving and that's all he wants from you. Faithfully serve and let your life serve God

**[43:40 - 43:46]** and serve his people and bring glory to his holy name. May our request as to stand on our feet

**[43:46 - 44:08]** and pray. Prayer that the Holy Spirit, he knows how to do his way. This moment I want you to take

**[44:08 - 44:18]** just a few seconds and acknowledge his grace upon your life. You are alive today because of his grace.

**[44:18 - 45:11]** How sweet sounds that say, the rest is lost, I see. Take a moment and thank God for his grace upon

**[45:11 - 45:17]** your life. Speak out to him and say thank you. I acknowledge his grace in your life, in your

**[45:17 - 45:23]** family, in your children, in your businesses, in your life. He has been so good. He's been so good.

**[45:23 - 45:29]** He protected you. This fire has brought you. It is because of his grace. He have found you when you

**[45:29 - 45:37]** are like Simon Samoa, when things were not working out, when those were not connecting, he found you.

**[45:37 - 45:45]** He found you. He found you. Grace located you. Grace located you. Grace located you. You are who you are

**[45:45 - 46:08]** and what you are. Just may I kindly request that you hold the shoulder of your neighbor on the right

**[46:08 - 46:13]** and on your left. Hold the shoulder of your neighbor on the right and on your left if you can please.

**[46:25 - 46:28]** You don't know what that person is going through. We're going to pray for one another.

**[46:29 - 46:39]** Pray for them. Probably their way Simon was at that moment, but pray for them as the Holy Spirit

**[46:39 - 46:42]** leads you. Pray for them. Pray for them. Go ahead and pray. Go ahead and pray.

**[47:41 - 47:47]** Every father, we thank you for this great morning. Thank you for your grace that locates us wherever we are.

**[47:48 - 47:53]** When we think nobody knows what we are going through you know and you locate us Lord.

**[47:54 - 48:01]** My father, because of that amazing grace, enable us Lord to surrender, to respond by surrender.

**[48:02 - 48:08]** All that you want us to surrender to you. And I pray that your Holy Spirit will speak to each one

**[48:08 - 48:14]** because we know that he's good at that. In Jesus' name, I ask and pray. Amen.

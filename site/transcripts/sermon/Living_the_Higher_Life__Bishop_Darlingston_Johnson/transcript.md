Therefore, do not do them. You can still do them Even though you're not living in them in other words, there was a time when your nature was such that this is what you did Now your nature is not that your nature is completely changed and because your nature is changed Don't continue to do those things you once lived in amen One more time say to the person next to you Live the higher life Amen, if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above so I want to I want to talk to you about learning how to live a life from above A life that is consistent with your spiritual identity now You see you work something before you are in Christ Someone else you are a brand new creation the Bible says So how do we live from above a life that is consistent with your spiritual identity now in Christ A life of faith in Christ a life of love For for one another a life of everlasting hope That causes you to be steadfast and secure No matter what is happening in this world You know Paul spoke earlier a wrote earlier in chapter one in addressing the the Corinthians I mean the Colossians and what he said that there was you know, I am giving thanks to God for you Because of your faith in Christ Your love for one another and your hope That was what Paul was looking for in the believers faith in Christ Love for one another And everlasting hope a step as of that keeps you faithful and true Even when life is extremely difficult Hallelujah That is what God looks for in us And that is what we should be looking for in ourselves Say faith in Christ And when the Bible talks about faith it's talking about faith in Christ All right Not just not faith in yourself Not faith in something else Not faith in faith Faith in Christ Amen God is looking for and we ought to be looking for faith in Christ Love for one another I know we've talked about the need to love God and we should love God But the focus of the New Testament when it comes to love is On loving one another Faith like God really wants from us is faith in Christ And what he wants from us is for us to truly walk in love To us one another and To possess this everlasting hope Of everlasting life That keeps us steadfast and anchored No matter what life brings We have a hope that keeps us secure Amen when those things are Active in your life and and growing You are growing spiritually Amen When those things are active in you faith in Christ your love for one another and your hope continues to grow That is spiritual growth Okay, and that really really pleases the Father And that's what we want We want to grow we want to grow we want to see faith in Christ We want to see love for one another we want to see our hope becoming stronger and stronger um And those are the Or Of someone who is living the higher life In Christ Amen A life from above a life that is consistent with your true spiritual identity A life of faith in Christ love of one another everlasting hope That produces a life of peace and power and purpose Amen A life of what say peace power And purpose And this is all made possible through our union with Christ say I am Jordan to Christ Apart from Christ, we cannot do this We cannot live the higher life Apart from him. So the source from which we Receive the ability To live the higher life is Christ and we'll talk about that a little bit further so live the higher life why Because listen to me It is actually better up there Yeah, it higher is better Last week I think yeah, it was last week Sunday. I was flying back from North Carolina And we've gotten the airplane and take off a lot of turbulence Taking off a lot of turbulence And then we got maybe about 10,000 Of feet And we broke through the clouds and it was all sunshine And it was calm And the ride was smooth There was not a change in the weather Down here it was a change in the altitude You see above Was better Higher Was better And that lasted Before about 40 minutes and then we sat we started to land So we had to Start to descend And we got into the DC area and there was a lot of wind again Extremely turbulent so I conclude the highest better Hey man I want to live my life From above And man, I want to live from where I am in Christ Where no matter the storms and the turbulence that takes place in this world I can respond to that From My position and my identity in Christ It is much smoother Up here And hear me you're going to have turbulence in this life One much I'm so the person next to you Live the higher life Is better And that's another reason why you should live the higher life It because that's the life you were designed for And man, Christians you are designed to live from above Yes, an illustration I heard years ago I believe it was Oral, but it's the first time Who that I heard it from Well, he was preaching the server that he talked about the the eagle that was raised In a chicken coop raised With chickens And so For for much of his earlier life it learned and thought it was a chicken And so behave like a chicken You know even worms from the dust You know just you know what chickens do And so this eagle Thought it was a chicken thought that was what it was made for Until one day an eagle flew over It said and and and It saw the eagle and it hurt the sound of the eagle and it something happened on the inside And it realized I got wings That can soar I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle And that thing lifted this head spread his wings and soared to live the life It was designed for Christians were not chickens So let's stop eating worms from the dust Let's Embrace our identity in Christ and all we are and all we have in him And let's determine We're going to soar Because we're called to live above The flesh We're called to live above sin We're called to live a life of victory We call it the higher life Jesus call it the abundant life That he came to give us a life of faith in Christ A life of love for one another A life of everlasting and steadfast hope A life carried in a rise by peace Power and purpose One more time raise your hand And declare in the name of Jesus I was born For the higher life I'm equipped to live above This world system Yeah, yeah Jesus said You're in this world But you are not Up this world And so our identity must be embraced for what we really are If we continue to think that we're mere sinners mere men And don't embrace our identity in Christ We live far beneath our privileges And the the higher life the abundant life we we have a right to Enjoy We will not Experience That would not be your portion In Jesus name I said that would not be your portion In Jesus name So now what is the key to living this life the key to living this high life is given to us in Colossians chapter two Verse 18 and 19 so could you please go there Ephesians chapter two verse 18 and 19 is the key for living From above Colossians 2 18. Let's read it together, please Let no one teach you Of your reward taking delight in false humility And worship of angels Intruding in those those things which he has not seen Daily puffed up by his fleshly mind. Let's read that one more time Let no one teach you or rob you Of your reward your reward here is the fullness of the life that you can have and you can walk in in Christ Jesus Amen. That's your reward Hallelujah Taking delight in what false humility and worship of angels Intruding in those states which he has not seen They live puffed up by his fleshly mind. I'm going to refer to that later I want you to keep that thought in your mind and then the next verse verse 19 and what Not Holding fast to the head from whom all the body Nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments grows With the increase that is from God that verse 19 tells us What is the absolute key and the and what is absolutely necessary For us to live from above and experience a higher life and that is to hold fast to the head why Because the head supplies Everything that the body needs to thrive In this case Paul tells us the head is Jesus Now when you say head the two things that should come to you to your mind one Authority In other words if Jesus is the head of the body that you are a part of It means you look to Jesus As the authority Over your life You listen to him you hear him You obey him You let him be the decision maker In your life all right, so Paul is saying Jesus is the head The authority over our lives the decision maker that we submit to and In particular when he refers to Christ as the head he's referring to Christ as the source Of everything We need to grow To talk to try to live the higher life He says from Christ home The body is nourished and knit together by Johnson ligaments So the body Receives from Christ the spiritual nutrients and nourishment It needs to grow and thrive You receive from Christ The head All that you need For you to grow and thrive this church as a body receives from Christ he is the source I hear me And the instruction is Hold fast to him if you hold fast to him as the source Which means to hold fast to your faith In him As your source You will receive From him Everything you need To experience increase And that increase covers every aspect of your life Come on say to the person next to you Jesus Is the source of my increase Or come a one more time Jesus is the source of my increase and Jesus as the source of your increase Has everything in him That you need To thrive You need Nothing other than No one other than Christ Jesus To increase and live The higher life Now What is the justification for this well the justification for this Is who Jesus is Okay, so go to Colossians 2 go to verse 9 and 10 Let's read this together for In him dwells All The fullness of the Godhead All right, so In Jesus All of God dwells Which means Everything God is Jesus is Everything God has Jesus has Everything God can do Jesus can do And that Jesus is your source If you were to take time to actually read Colossians one more more you you will see that he is the creator of all things In heaven Any earth visible Any visible Principle is Empowers He's the creator of all things that is the source of all things Says that he Has to pre-eminence In all things I hear me so here is Jesus who Is God possessing everything God possesses able to do everything God can do Are you hear me all who God is he is And then the scripture says in verse 10 You are Complete In him in other words everything you need You have In him Now How will you not be completing him If the one you're in The whole Godhead In 12 I mean if you are in God What do you lack If you are joined to the one Who is exactly Like God In every dimension What do you lack? child of God needs to realize that he Is Complete In Christ Jesus and the reason why he is completing Christ Jesus Because in Jesus the entire Godhead To us bodily And right there smack in the middle of Jesus I find you how can you be in the middle of the ocean and not be wet Can't be It meant if you if if if you're in the middle of the ocean unite I mean your your body is in the ocean And you're completely surrounded by water wet is a Forgone fact Is that anything you've got to try to do Do you have to try to be wet when you're already in the ocean you need to recognize in the ocean. Hopefully you can swim But that's the point that's the point Paul is making This is who Jesus is and in salvation God has put us inside of Christ And therefore we are complete We lack nothing and we now must hold fast to that fact We must make sure that our faith in Christ as being sufficient for all things and the completion That we have in him is a reality believe that don't let anyone distract you And therefore disconnect your mind From this singular focus on Jesus as being your source And because he's your source because of who he is you are Complete But that's a warning And that's what I said we're going to go back to go back to verse 18 218 That's a warning let no one cheat you Of your reward note let no one cheat you of all of this blessing this higher light That can be yours Now hear me that's a warning there because what he's saying is You are in him you are complete in him And you need to hold fast to him To that reality You need to hold fast to that Because Satan cannot undo What God has done for you in Christ But if Satan can succeed in Disconnecting or having you this become disconnected From this singular focus on Christ alone As your sufficiency So that now you begin to look elsewhere For what you already have in Christ You will be cheated Of the experience you could be having in Christ Jesus It said it said coming across clearly I'm not sure Maybe okay, let's use a light bulb A good New light bulb has the ability to shine It has everything in it and needs to shine Except power And so for it to shine you have to connect it To the power source And as long as it's connected to the power source The light bulb bulb will shine I hear me but if Something happens And it is disconnected From the power source is still a light bulb It's just not shining Because the source of power that makes this shine Isn't being received You are the light bulb Christ is the power He's the head he supplies everything you need But if our minds become disconnected from It's singular focus on Christ as our source So that we start looking elsewhere for solutions We become disconnected from that source And instead of shining We're walking darkness So do not allow anything anyone To cause your mind To lose its focus on Christ alone As Your source of Everything You need For life and God in the sick Christ Is my sufficient Source I am Connected to him Complete Light bulb that is shining Because I'm a light bulb Connected To Jesus So one of some of the ways that's the enemy tries to disconnect us From our singular focus On Christ As our Source and the only source we need Because in him the fullness of the Godhead wealth So connected to him we have everything we need That is what he talks about he said One of the things Satan does he talks here about People who begin to Come up with other ways To get favor From God So he talks about these philosophies He talks about Those who Well Christ yeah, but in order to have favor from God you also need Have this relationship with angels Have this wonderful deep revelation of angels and And begin to you know false humility if you begin to You got to you can't you can't you can't dress well you can You're looking too good you got to Wear Certain types of clothes you got to You got to pray 3 a.m. Every morning You got to engage in Some of these other mystical things Uh You got to understand the complexity of the spiritual world and Principle of his and powers and how to deal with this one and how to deal with that one You got to know that and they begin to bring all of these other things And at the end of the day You're no longer looking to Christ. You no longer feel in him You know you hear me you no longer feel that That your relationship with Jesus Christ your faith in him For who he is and what he accomplished is sufficient the fact that he is your light is sufficient You lose that confidence In Christ and in his efficiency and you start looking For what you already have In all of these other things That you're being told you got to do and then you sit there and say that's deep Yeah, I don't I don't want to go to harvest anymore get it y'all they talk about his grace Preva we talk about grace because grace points you right to Jesus It the day you lose the day you lose the revelation of the grace of God you cannot live the higher life We're talking about oh you may have all of these These streams and all the stuff where you go to hell and you come back and I don't know how much of that hasn't a truth in it Are you understanding me but here's the bottom line anything anyone any experience that takes your mind away from Christ as the one in whom You live The one who is the source of your life and therefore makes you complete Any revelation no matter how deep it sounds No matter how many stories they got your Back it up It takes your mind of Of a Christ and it has you looking elsewhere Or looking for more because somehow Christ Himself alone is not enough Any of that is from the enemy and the design and intention is to break Your focus on Christ and what will result will not be the life God has called you to live all right Say I am in Christ In whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells I'm living smack in the middle of divinity Everything I need is located Inside of him Anything not in him Is not anything I need Hallelujah You know again if it were to read Colossians chapter one Paul gave thanks in that chapter for the fruit That the gospel was producing he said all over the world The gospel was producing fruit And he was giving God thanks and the evidence of that was in the Colossian church because he gave He saw their faith in Christ's glory He saw their love for one another increase and he saw them being steadfast in hope going through tests and trials And he says this is the fruit of the gospel He says this gospel is producing fruit all over the world Inside of people you know, there was people's lives were being transformed By this gospel and he tells you exactly in Colossians when he says In this gospel it tells you about the grace of God So this gospel that tells you about the grace of God was producing fruit in people all over the world In the Colossians church it was producing fruit and Paul was giving thanks, but then Immediately after saying how thankful he was for the fruit that he saw and the good things that was happening in this church He said and I pray I pray for you all the time I pray for you that God will give you strength I pray for you that you will get understanding I pray for you that you will be steadfast He immediately After praising God for the wonderful growth he saw happening in this church Which was the result of the gospel of grace that he will have been caring and responding to He immediately Says and for this reason I'm praying for you all the all the time And you know what I heard that I said what I mean it usually if If people are doing well spiritually If they're growing in their faith in Christ they're growing in their love for one another they're growing in their That they hope Why is Paul So concerned that he's praying for them so much. I would think you pray for The ones who are struggling But here Paul is saying praying for the ones who are doing well because for understood That these people who are doing well live in an environment Where they are going to be exposed to all kinds of things That could threaten their very faith in Christ And so he understood that In the enemy Doesn't want you and me to live this higher life And so when he sees us living this higher life from the revelation of our identity in Christ He will do whatever he can to try to interrupt that and to keep us from maintaining our focus on Christ And for that we have to pray so that Those who are Living the higher life Will continue to live in the The higher life those who are focusing on Christ will continue to focus on Christ That they will not be distracted by circumstances or by philosophies By all of these new age religions and by all the kinds of things that you hear that the enemy constantly throws at us Hoping that if this doesn't work this will work if that doesn't work This will work that at some point we will listen to some lie embrace some lie And take our focus over Jesus So to ensure that people who are already Growing continue to grow process. I'm going to keep praying I'm going to keep praying for them so that nothing the enemy tries to do to distract them from Jesus will succeed Amen So one of the things we need to do church as a church is pray for one another Pray for ourselves and pray for one another that in the midst of all that we are exposed to here I mean and through the internet through television through our schools I mean everywhere we go you have these philosophies these these false ideas traditions of men and and and and all of these things that are being taught that are not according to Christ That's a lot of spiritual warfare that is taking place to control your thoughts and minds and the ultimate goal Is to take your mind away from Jesus present an alternative to Jesus even disguised it as though is Jesus But it's not Jesus because if he can disconnect Your minds from its focus on Christ. It's like that light bulb that has been disconnected from the source All right All right, so quickly let's let's let me let me let me let me and Paul go back to Colossians 31 and we're going to end now If you are raised with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God Set your mind on things above not on things on the earth For you died and your light is hit so since you are risen to Christ say since Not if as though it didn't happen in however, this is a reality insolvation you ascended That's why you can live the higher life because you have ascended with Christ spiritually Christ When he arose You arose in him when he ascended You ascended in him where Christ is You are So seek the things which are above For two reasons again the things which are above are Betta and then secondly Above is actually where you now live that is your address Yes Spiritually you got to understand your spirit lives In this place we're calling above That's why you live That's why you're living Then why would you be seeking things on earth All of us are not living where in the United States Because you're in the United States What do you naturally seek Things that are where you live if you are in Nigeria And you needed to go to the hospital You will have to seek a hospital in Nigeria Because that's where you live If you're in the US and you want to seek a hospital You got a lot of good hospitals here Why not take advantage of the many good hospitals here And find a good hospital right where you are Because you're where the hospitals are If you're here Why would you go to Liberia To seek medical here That's my country now your own life Nobody here in that right mind I think Would be in the United States America where you have the best hospital The best doctors And you got really ill He said oh, I'm going to Liberia as a JFK No, no, no, no, if you are here You know you are here where the best hospitals are You're gonna spend your time seeking the best hospitals Because where you are the best hospitals are You follow the illustration This is where you are And the things here are far better than the things here Why be here and seeking things here Why being Christ where the Everything that is of God is And instead of seeking the things that are of God where you are You leave those things to come and seek earthly things So go ahead If you're going to live the higher life Make this decision I'm going to seek the things which are above first because they are better second That's why I am That means I have access To God I have access to all God is all God has All God can do I'm actually there where all of those things are available in Christ And so that's what I am going to be seeking Then he says set your mind on things which are above Again The whole intention of the enemy in his strategy is to get your mind off of things which are above To give you a reason to want to focus on things on earth But that is a strategy He cannot undo what Christ has done But if he can get you to focus here He can render you powerless Because you're no longer focusing on the source So here'll be Make a decision You're going to set your mind on Christ And on the things that belong to him That's why I get meditation is so important Because a practical way for doing that Is by meditating on his word Amen And learn to change the channel say say learn to change The channel If you're watching a show on TV And you don't like what's after You don't like the characters And you don't like the movies You don't fight with the character You don't yell at the TV You don't go find the actor And not let you do just you got your remote You change the channel Are you hear me So when the enemy is putting things And pumping things into your mind That are disturbing you And causing all kinds of stuff Hey Click Change the channel Just say no I want to think of things above Right now Right now These thoughts are not helping me one bit Click I want to think of You follow me That's why I get If you got the word already in you You can change the channel And then you got a mouth Your mouth is a remote Control Seriously You can change the channel with your mouth So all of these thoughts are coming That are causing you to live from below And you know that you're You're you're living above So click I am in Christ My By By By Life is completing him Everything he is I am Everything he has I have Things don't look good right now But I'm living from above Hey hear me Literally You can change the channel With your mouth Remember this And my mouth Is the remote control That God has given me To change the channel That my mind Is dwelling on And what we want to do Is to set our mind on things above And then he says he says Modify the deeds Of the flesh now I promise you I'm ending But there are a lot of stuff That we are still doing We shouldn't be doing Fondication, adultery, lying, anger, Jealousy, covetousness, idolatry Bad mouthing people Cussing And on and on and on You lived in those things before you Became a Christian that was your nature Now that is no longer your nature So God says Modify But the deeds of the flesh To death Now notice you didn't say Crucify yourself Because you that old man that need to be crucified Is already dead What he says is That old man that is dead Left some things behind And those things don't belong to the new man So take those things to old man left behind in your mind And discard them They no longer belong to the new man There's a house On the house on the outside is nice But the man who lives there was dirty And so the house had a lot of Dirt the coffees were dirty The walls had a lot of dirt on it The furniture were all old and And just out of date And you buy the house Because the old man that lived there died And so the house was sold You bought the house And you moved in Are you the old man Your new man and this new man is very clean This new man doesn't like dirt He wants everything in order. He doesn't like confusion He moved in the house that he bought The old man is no longer dead because the old man died That old man that lived in sin That you once were on the cross In fact, I shouldn't just say die, God put him to death He was executed with Christ on the cross He no longer lives there So you move into the house where he once lived And you look around And he used to smoke a lot too So you got to smell a nicotine there You follow me you got So what do you do Do you say oh well, I'm just going to live here Are you going to be comfortable there Are you going to accept that What are you going to do the first thing you're going to do is we got to clean this place And you begin to take all of the furniture that belong to the old man that no longer belongs to you say There's a new person living here You and me we don't agree We are not in agreement So you begin to discard all of that stuff Fornication you got to go Adopted Lying No Envent no Gossip Glutiny And one by one You dismisses you know you know no that's not who I am This is who I am your new identity. I'm not a chicken Even from the dust On worms I'm an eagle with wings And I'm sorry So you no longer you are no longer compatible I'm going to stop putting all of these things out of my life to make room for the new So he says Modify put out these things, but then he says also put on so you throw these things out And then you just kind of you start to bring in the things from Christ the things which are above and you start to Move them into your mind and into your life Do you hear me Father I pray that the Holy Spirit will take what we have taught and by your power Help us to Live this higher life That we're called to live In Jesus name Amen, okay, well God bless you All right, everybody shall say the higher life It's better Say up here It's better In Jesus name

**[05:00 - 05:02]** Love for one another

**[05:02 - 05:07]** And everlasting hope a step as of that keeps you faithful and true

**[05:08 - 05:12]** Even when life is extremely difficult

**[05:13 - 05:15]** Hallelujah

**[05:15 - 05:18]** That is what God looks for in us

**[05:19 - 05:22]** And that is what we should be looking for in ourselves

**[05:23 - 05:25]** Say faith in Christ

**[05:26 - 05:30]** And when the Bible talks about faith it's talking about faith in Christ

**[05:32 - 05:34]** All right

**[05:34 - 05:36]** Not just not faith in yourself

**[05:36 - 05:38]** Not faith in something else

**[05:39 - 05:41]** Not faith in faith

**[05:41 - 05:42]** Faith in

**[05:42 - 05:43]** Christ

**[05:43 - 05:45]** Amen

**[05:45 - 05:49]** God is looking for and we ought to be looking for faith in Christ

**[05:51 - 05:55]** Love for one another I know we've talked about the need to love God and we should love God

**[05:56 - 06:00]** But the focus of the New Testament when it comes to love is

**[06:00 - 06:02]** On loving one another

**[06:03 - 06:07]** Faith like God really wants from us is faith in Christ

**[06:08 - 06:13]** And what he wants from us is for us to truly walk in love

**[06:14 - 06:16]** To us one another

**[06:16 - 06:18]** and

**[06:18 - 06:20]** To possess this everlasting hope

**[06:22 - 06:24]** Of everlasting life

**[06:25 - 06:27]** That keeps us steadfast and anchored

**[06:28 - 06:30]** No matter what life brings

**[06:31 - 06:33]** We have a hope that keeps us secure

**[06:34 - 06:35]** Amen

**[06:35 - 06:37]** when those things are

**[06:38 - 06:41]** Active in your life and and growing

**[06:42 - 06:44]** You are growing spiritually

**[06:45 - 06:46]** Amen

**[06:46 - 06:53]** When those things are active in you faith in Christ your love for one another and your hope continues to grow

**[06:54 - 06:56]** That is spiritual growth

**[06:58 - 07:02]** Okay, and that really really pleases the Father

**[07:04 - 07:06]** And that's what we want

**[07:06 - 07:10]** We want to grow we want to grow we want to see faith in Christ

**[07:10 - 07:15]** We want to see love for one another we want to see our hope becoming stronger and stronger

**[07:16 - 07:18]** um

**[07:18 - 07:20]** And those are

**[07:20 - 07:22]** the

**[07:22 - 07:24]** Or

**[07:24 - 07:26]** Of someone who is living

**[07:27 - 07:29]** the higher life

**[07:29 - 07:31]** In Christ

**[07:31 - 07:32]** Amen

**[07:32 - 07:37]** A life from above a life that is consistent with your true spiritual identity

**[07:38 - 07:42]** A life of faith in Christ love of one another everlasting hope

**[07:43 - 07:47]** That produces a life of peace and power and purpose

**[07:47 - 07:49]** Amen

**[07:49 - 07:51]** A life of what say peace

**[07:52 - 07:53]** power

**[07:53 - 07:55]** And purpose

**[07:55 - 07:59]** And this is all made possible through our union with Christ

**[08:00 - 08:02]** say I am

**[08:02 - 08:03]** Jordan to

**[08:03 - 08:04]** Christ

**[08:04 - 08:08]** Apart from Christ, we cannot do this

**[08:09 - 08:11]** We cannot live the higher life

**[08:12 - 08:16]** Apart from him. So the source from which we

**[08:17 - 08:19]** Receive the ability

**[08:19 - 08:23]** To live the higher life is Christ and we'll talk about that

**[08:24 - 08:25]** a little bit further

**[08:25 - 08:27]** so

**[08:27 - 08:28]** live

**[08:28 - 08:30]** the higher life

**[08:30 - 08:32]** why

**[08:33 - 08:35]** Because listen to me

**[08:35 - 08:36]** It is actually better up there

**[08:40 - 08:41]** Yeah, it higher is better

**[08:44 - 08:48]** Last week I think yeah, it was last week Sunday. I was flying back from North Carolina

**[08:49 - 08:51]** And we've gotten the airplane and

**[08:52 - 08:54]** take off

**[08:54 - 08:56]** a lot of turbulence

**[08:56 - 08:58]** Taking off a lot of turbulence

**[08:59 - 09:02]** And then we got maybe about 10,000

**[09:02 - 09:06]** Of

**[09:06 - 09:08]** feet

**[09:08 - 09:11]** And we broke through the clouds and it was all sunshine

**[09:13 - 09:15]** And it was calm

**[09:16 - 09:20]** And the ride was smooth

**[09:20 - 09:22]** There was not a change in the weather

**[09:23 - 09:25]** Down here it was a change in the altitude

**[09:27 - 09:29]** You see above

**[09:30 - 09:32]** Was better

**[09:32 - 09:34]** Higher

**[09:34 - 09:35]** Was better

**[09:35 - 09:37]** And that lasted

**[09:37 - 09:41]** Before about 40 minutes and then we sat we started to land

**[09:42 - 09:44]** So we had to

**[09:44 - 09:46]** Start to descend

**[09:46 - 09:50]** And we got into the DC area and there was a lot of wind again

**[09:51 - 09:55]** Extremely turbulent so I conclude the highest better

**[09:58 - 10:00]** Hey man

**[10:00 - 10:02]** I want to live my life

**[10:03 - 10:05]** From above

**[10:05 - 10:08]** And man, I want to live from where I am in Christ

**[10:10 - 10:14]** Where no matter the storms and the turbulence that takes place in this world

**[10:16 - 10:18]** I can respond to that

**[10:20 - 10:21]** From

**[10:21 - 10:24]** My position and my identity in Christ

**[10:25 - 10:27]** It is much smoother

**[10:29 - 10:32]** Up here

**[10:32 - 10:36]** And hear me you're going to have turbulence in this life

**[10:38 - 10:40]** One much I'm so the person next to you

**[10:40 - 10:48]** Live the higher life

**[10:48 - 10:50]** Is better

**[10:51 - 10:53]** And that's another reason why you should live the higher life

**[10:53 - 10:56]** It because that's the life you were designed for

**[10:59 - 11:03]** And man, Christians you are designed to live from above

**[11:06 - 11:08]** Yes, an illustration I heard years ago

**[11:08 - 11:10]** I believe it was Oral, but it's the first time

**[11:10 - 11:12]** Who that I heard it from

**[11:12 - 11:17]** Well, he was preaching the server that he talked about the the eagle that was raised

**[11:18 - 11:20]** In a chicken coop

**[11:20 - 11:21]** raised

**[11:21 - 11:23]** With chickens

**[11:23 - 11:25]** And so

**[11:25 - 11:31]** For for much of his earlier life it learned and thought it was a chicken

**[11:32 - 11:34]** And so behave like a chicken

**[11:35 - 11:37]** You know even worms from the dust

**[11:38 - 11:41]** You know just you know what chickens do

**[11:42 - 11:44]** And so this eagle

**[11:44 - 11:47]** Thought it was a chicken thought that was what it was made for

**[11:49 - 11:51]** Until one day an eagle flew over

**[11:52 - 11:54]** It said and and and

**[11:55 - 12:00]** It saw the eagle and it hurt the sound of the eagle and it something happened on the inside

**[12:01 - 12:03]** And it realized

**[12:04 - 12:06]** I got wings

**[12:06 - 12:08]** That can soar

**[12:09 - 12:11]** I'm not a chicken

**[12:12 - 12:13]** I'm an eagle

**[12:13 - 12:17]** And that thing lifted this head spread his wings and soared

**[12:20 - 12:22]** to live the life

**[12:23 - 12:27]** It was designed for

**[12:27 - 12:29]** Christians were not chickens

**[12:31 - 12:33]** So let's stop eating

**[12:33 - 12:35]** worms

**[12:36 - 12:38]** from the dust

**[12:39 - 12:41]** Let's

**[12:41 - 12:44]** Embrace our identity in Christ and all we are and all we have in him

**[12:45 - 12:47]** And let's determine

**[12:47 - 12:49]** We're going to soar

**[12:49 - 12:51]** Because we're called to live above

**[12:52 - 12:54]** The flesh

**[12:54 - 12:57]** We're called to live above sin

**[12:58 - 13:01]** We're called to live a life of victory

**[13:03 - 13:05]** We call it the higher life Jesus call it the abundant life

**[13:06 - 13:09]** That he came to give us a life of faith in Christ

**[13:10 - 13:12]** A life of love for one another

**[13:12 - 13:15]** A life of everlasting and steadfast hope

**[13:15 - 13:18]** A life carried in a rise by peace

**[13:19 - 13:20]** Power and purpose

**[13:23 - 13:25]** One more time raise your hand

**[13:25 - 13:27]** And declare in the name of Jesus

**[13:29 - 13:31]** I was born

**[13:31 - 13:33]** For the higher life

**[13:34 - 13:38]** I'm equipped to live above

**[13:39 - 13:41]** This world system

**[13:43 - 13:44]** Yeah, yeah

**[13:44 - 13:46]** Jesus said

**[13:46 - 13:50]** You're in this world

**[13:50 - 13:52]** But you are not

**[13:52 - 13:53]** Up this world

**[13:53 - 13:58]** And so our identity must be embraced for what we really are

**[14:00 - 14:03]** If we continue to think that we're mere sinners

**[14:04 - 14:06]** mere men

**[14:06 - 14:09]** And don't embrace our identity in Christ

**[14:09 - 14:11]** We live far beneath our privileges

**[14:12 - 14:17]** And the the higher life the abundant life we we have a right to

**[14:18 - 14:19]** Enjoy

**[14:19 - 14:20]** We will not

**[14:20 - 14:22]** Experience

**[14:22 - 14:24]** That would not be your portion

**[14:25 - 14:27]** In Jesus name

**[14:27 - 14:29]** I said that would not be your portion

**[14:30 - 14:32]** In Jesus name

**[14:32 - 14:39]** So now what is the key to living this life the key to living this high life is given to us in Colossians chapter two

**[14:39 - 14:42]** Verse 18 and 19 so could you please go there

**[14:43 - 14:47]** Ephesians chapter two verse 18 and 19 is the key for living

**[14:48 - 14:52]** From above

**[14:52 - 14:54]** Colossians 2 18. Let's read it together, please

**[14:55 - 14:58]** Let no one teach you

**[14:59 - 15:01]** Of your reward

**[15:01 - 15:04]** taking delight in false humility

**[15:05 - 15:07]** And worship of angels

**[15:07 - 15:10]** Intruding in those those things which he has not seen

**[15:11 - 15:16]** Daily puffed up by his fleshly mind. Let's read that one more time

**[15:17 - 15:20]** Let no one teach you or rob you

**[15:21 - 15:29]** Of your reward your reward here is the fullness of the life that you can have and you can walk in in Christ Jesus

**[15:30 - 15:32]** Amen. That's your reward

**[15:33 - 15:35]** Hallelujah

**[15:36 - 15:41]** Taking delight in what false humility and worship of angels

**[15:42 - 15:45]** Intruding in those states which he has not seen

**[15:46 - 15:51]** They live puffed up by his fleshly mind. I'm going to refer to that later

**[15:52 - 15:55]** I want you to keep that thought in your mind and then the next verse verse

**[15:56 - 15:58]** 19 and what

**[15:58 - 15:59]** Not

**[15:59 - 16:04]** Holding fast to the head from whom all the body

**[16:05 - 16:09]** Nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments grows

**[16:10 - 16:15]** With the increase that is from God that verse 19 tells us

**[16:16 - 16:21]** What is the absolute key and the and what is absolutely necessary

**[16:22 - 16:28]** For us to live from above and experience a higher life and that is to hold

**[16:30 - 16:32]** fast

**[16:32 - 16:34]** to the head

**[16:34 - 16:36]** why

**[16:36 - 16:38]** Because the head

**[16:38 - 16:40]** supplies

**[16:41 - 16:45]** Everything that the body needs to thrive

**[16:47 - 16:48]** In this case

**[16:48 - 16:51]** Paul tells us the head is Jesus

**[16:54 - 17:00]** Now when you say head the two things that should come to you to your mind one

**[17:02 - 17:03]** Authority

**[17:03 - 17:08]** In other words if Jesus is the head of the body that you are a part of

**[17:09 - 17:11]** It means you look to Jesus

**[17:12 - 17:14]** As the authority

**[17:14 - 17:16]** Over your life

**[17:16 - 17:18]** You listen to him you hear him

**[17:19 - 17:21]** You obey him

**[17:21 - 17:23]** You let him be the decision maker

**[17:24 - 17:27]** In your life all right, so Paul is saying

**[17:29 - 17:31]** Jesus is the head

**[17:31 - 17:36]** The authority over our lives the decision maker that we submit to

**[17:38 - 17:40]** and

**[17:40 - 17:45]** In particular when he refers to Christ as the head he's referring to Christ as the source

**[17:47 - 17:49]** Of everything

**[17:50 - 17:52]** We need to grow

**[17:53 - 17:57]** To talk to try to live the higher life

**[17:58 - 18:02]** He says from Christ home

**[18:02 - 18:07]** The body is nourished and knit together by Johnson ligaments

**[18:08 - 18:10]** So the body

**[18:10 - 18:16]** Receives from Christ the spiritual nutrients and nourishment

**[18:16 - 18:19]** It needs to grow and thrive

**[18:20 - 18:23]** You receive from Christ

**[18:24 - 18:26]** The head

**[18:26 - 18:28]** All that you need

**[18:29 - 18:37]** For you to grow and thrive this church as a body receives from Christ he is the source

**[18:40 - 18:41]** I hear me

**[18:41 - 18:43]** And the instruction is

**[18:45 - 18:51]** Hold fast to him if you hold fast to him as the source

**[18:53 - 18:56]** Which means to hold fast to your faith

**[18:57 - 18:59]** In him

**[18:59 - 19:01]** As your source

**[19:02 - 19:04]** You will receive

**[19:04 - 19:06]** From him

**[19:06 - 19:08]** Everything you need

**[19:08 - 19:10]** To experience increase

**[19:13 - 19:17]** And that increase covers every aspect of your life

**[19:18 - 19:20]** Come on say to the person next to you Jesus

**[19:21 - 19:25]** Is the source of my increase

**[19:26 - 19:28]** Or come a one more time Jesus is

**[19:30 - 19:32]** the source

**[19:32 - 19:34]** of my

**[19:34 - 19:38]** increase and

**[19:38 - 19:42]** Jesus as the source of your increase

**[19:43 - 19:45]** Has everything in him

**[19:46 - 19:48]** That you need

**[19:48 - 19:52]** To thrive

**[19:52 - 19:54]** You need

**[19:54 - 19:56]** Nothing other than

**[19:56 - 19:57]** No one other than

**[19:58 - 20:01]** Christ Jesus

**[20:01 - 20:04]** To increase and live

**[20:05 - 20:08]** The higher life

**[20:08 - 20:10]** Now

**[20:10 - 20:15]** What is the justification for this well the justification for this

**[20:16 - 20:18]** Is who Jesus is

**[20:19 - 20:23]** Okay, so go to Colossians 2 go to verse 9 and 10

**[20:27 - 20:29]** Let's read this together for

**[20:29 - 20:31]** In him dwells

**[20:32 - 20:34]** All

**[20:34 - 20:36]** The fullness of the Godhead

**[20:37 - 20:39]** All right, so

**[20:39 - 20:41]** In Jesus

**[20:42 - 20:44]** All of God

**[20:45 - 20:46]** dwells

**[20:46 - 20:48]** Which means

**[20:48 - 20:50]** Everything God is

**[20:52 - 20:53]** Jesus is

**[20:53 - 20:59]** Everything God has

**[21:00 - 21:02]** Jesus has

**[21:02 - 21:04]** Everything God can do

**[21:05 - 21:07]** Jesus can do

**[21:07 - 21:10]** And that Jesus is your source

**[21:15 - 21:23]** If you were to take time to actually read Colossians one more more you you will see that he is the creator of all things

**[21:24 - 21:26]** In heaven

**[21:26 - 21:28]** Any earth

**[21:28 - 21:29]** visible

**[21:29 - 21:31]** Any visible

**[21:31 - 21:32]** Principle is

**[21:32 - 21:34]** Empowers

**[21:34 - 21:39]** He's the creator of all things that is the source of all things

**[21:39 - 21:41]** Says that he

**[21:41 - 21:43]** Has to pre-eminence

**[21:43 - 21:45]** In all things

**[21:45 - 21:48]** I hear me so here is Jesus who

**[21:49 - 21:51]** Is God

**[21:51 - 21:53]** possessing everything God possesses

**[21:54 - 21:56]** able to do everything God can do

**[21:56 - 21:59]** Are you hear me all who God is he is

**[22:00 - 22:02]** And then the scripture says in verse 10

**[22:04 - 22:06]** You

**[22:06 - 22:08]** are

**[22:08 - 22:10]** Complete

**[22:11 - 22:13]** In him in other words

**[22:13 - 22:15]** everything you need

**[22:16 - 22:18]** You have

**[22:18 - 22:20]** In him

**[22:20 - 22:22]** Now

**[22:22 - 22:25]** How will you not be completing him

**[22:26 - 22:28]** If the one you're in

**[22:28 - 22:30]** The whole Godhead

**[22:31 - 22:33]** In 12

**[22:33 - 22:35]** I mean if you are in

**[22:35 - 22:42]** God

**[22:42 - 22:48]** What do you lack

**[22:48 - 22:51]** If you are joined to the one

**[22:52 - 22:54]** Who is exactly

**[22:54 - 22:56]** Like God

**[22:56 - 22:58]** In every dimension

**[22:59 - 23:01]** What do you

**[23:01 - 23:09]** lack?

**[23:09 - 23:13]** child of God needs to realize that he

**[23:15 - 23:17]** Is

**[23:17 - 23:19]** Complete

**[23:20 - 23:21]** In

**[23:21 - 23:25]** Christ Jesus and the reason why he is completing Christ Jesus

**[23:26 - 23:30]** Because in Jesus the entire Godhead

**[23:32 - 23:34]** To us bodily

**[23:35 - 23:39]** And right there smack in the middle of Jesus

**[23:41 - 23:49]** I find you how can you be in the middle of the ocean and not be wet

**[23:55 - 23:56]** Can't be

**[23:56 - 24:01]** It meant if you if if if you're in the middle of the ocean unite

**[24:01 - 24:03]** I mean your your body is in the ocean

**[24:04 - 24:06]** And you're completely surrounded by water

**[24:10 - 24:12]** wet is a

**[24:12 - 24:14]** Forgone fact

**[24:14 - 24:16]** Is that anything you've got to try to do

**[24:18 - 24:27]** Do you have to try to be wet when you're already in the ocean you need to recognize in the ocean. Hopefully you can swim

**[24:30 - 24:32]** But that's the point that's the point Paul is making

**[24:33 - 24:39]** This is who Jesus is and in salvation God has put us inside of Christ

**[24:40 - 24:42]** And therefore we are complete

**[24:43 - 24:50]** We lack nothing and we now must hold fast to that fact

**[24:51 - 24:56]** We must make sure that our faith in Christ as being

**[24:57 - 24:59]** sufficient for all things

**[24:59 - 25:01]** and the completion

**[25:02 - 25:05]** That we have in him is a reality

**[25:05 - 25:07]** believe that

**[25:07 - 25:09]** don't let anyone

**[25:10 - 25:14]** distract you

**[25:14 - 25:16]** And therefore disconnect your mind

**[25:17 - 25:20]** From this singular focus on Jesus

**[25:21 - 25:23]** as being your source

**[25:24 - 25:27]** And because he's your source because of who he is

**[25:28 - 25:30]** you are

**[25:30 - 25:37]** Complete

**[25:37 - 25:39]** But that's a warning

**[25:39 - 25:42]** And that's what I said we're going to go back to go back to verse 18

**[25:43 - 25:44]** 218

**[25:44 - 25:46]** That's a warning let no one

**[25:47 - 25:49]** cheat you

**[25:49 - 25:53]** Of your reward note let no one cheat you of all of this blessing this higher light

**[25:54 - 25:56]** That can be yours

**[25:57 - 26:00]** Now hear me that's a warning there because what he's saying is

**[26:02 - 26:06]** You are in him you are complete in him

**[26:07 - 26:09]** And you need to hold fast

**[26:12 - 26:14]** to him

**[26:14 - 26:16]** To that reality

**[26:16 - 26:17]** You need to hold fast to that

**[26:18 - 26:19]** Because

**[26:19 - 26:21]** Satan cannot undo

**[26:22 - 26:24]** What God has done for you in Christ

**[26:25 - 26:28]** But if Satan can succeed in

**[26:28 - 26:32]** Disconnecting or having you this become disconnected

**[26:33 - 26:36]** From this singular focus on Christ alone

**[26:37 - 26:40]** As your sufficiency

**[26:40 - 26:43]** So that now you begin to look elsewhere

**[26:44 - 26:46]** For what you already have in Christ

**[26:47 - 26:49]** You will be cheated

**[26:50 - 26:53]** Of the experience you could be having in Christ Jesus

**[26:58 - 27:00]** It said it said coming across clearly I'm not sure

**[27:05 - 27:07]** Maybe okay, let's use a light bulb

**[27:08 - 27:10]** A good

**[27:10 - 27:13]** New light bulb has the ability to shine

**[27:15 - 27:17]** It has everything in it and needs to shine

**[27:17 - 27:19]** Except power

**[27:21 - 27:25]** And so for it to shine you have to connect it

**[27:26 - 27:28]** To the power source

**[27:28 - 27:31]** And as long as it's connected to the power source

**[27:32 - 27:34]** The light bulb bulb will shine

**[27:38 - 27:39]** I hear me

**[27:39 - 27:41]** but if

**[27:41 - 27:43]** Something happens

**[27:43 - 27:45]** And it is disconnected

**[27:46 - 27:48]** From the power source is still a light bulb

**[27:49 - 27:51]** It's just not shining

**[27:52 - 27:56]** Because the source of power that makes this shine

**[27:57 - 28:01]** Isn't being received

**[28:01 - 28:03]** You are the light bulb

**[28:04 - 28:06]** Christ is the power

**[28:07 - 28:10]** He's the head he supplies everything you need

**[28:10 - 28:15]** But if our minds become disconnected from

**[28:15 - 28:19]** It's singular focus on Christ as our source

**[28:20 - 28:24]** So that we start looking elsewhere for solutions

**[28:25 - 28:29]** We become disconnected from that source

**[28:29 - 28:31]** And instead of shining

**[28:32 - 28:38]** We're walking darkness

**[28:38 - 28:42]** So do not allow anything anyone

**[28:43 - 28:45]** To cause your mind

**[28:46 - 28:51]** To lose its focus on Christ alone

**[28:52 - 28:54]** As

**[28:54 - 28:56]** Your source of

**[28:56 - 28:58]** Everything

**[28:59 - 29:01]** You need

**[29:02 - 29:04]** For life and God in the sick Christ

**[29:05 - 29:07]** Is my

**[29:08 - 29:10]** sufficient

**[29:10 - 29:12]** Source

**[29:12 - 29:14]** I am

**[29:14 - 29:16]** Connected to him

**[29:16 - 29:18]** Complete

**[29:18 - 29:21]** Light bulb that is shining

**[29:21 - 29:23]** Because I'm a light bulb

**[29:23 - 29:24]** Connected

**[29:24 - 29:31]** To Jesus

**[29:31 - 29:35]** So one of some of the ways that's the enemy

**[29:36 - 29:37]** tries to disconnect us

**[29:39 - 29:40]** From our singular focus

**[29:41 - 29:43]** On Christ

**[29:43 - 29:45]** As our

**[29:45 - 29:47]** Source and the only source we need

**[29:48 - 29:51]** Because in him the fullness of the Godhead wealth

**[29:51 - 29:53]** So connected to him we have everything we need

**[29:54 - 29:56]** That is what he talks about he said

**[29:56 - 29:59]** One of the things Satan does he talks here about

**[30:00 - 30:02]** People who begin to

**[30:04 - 30:06]** Come up with other ways

**[30:07 - 30:09]** To get favor

**[30:09 - 30:11]** From God

**[30:11 - 30:13]** So he talks about these philosophies

**[30:13 - 30:15]** He talks about

**[30:15 - 30:16]** Those who

**[30:16 - 30:20]** Well Christ yeah, but in order to have favor from God you also need

**[30:23 - 30:25]** Have this relationship with angels

**[30:26 - 30:29]** Have this wonderful deep revelation of angels

**[30:30 - 30:32]** and

**[30:32 - 30:36]** And begin to you know false humility if you begin to

**[30:37 - 30:41]** You got to you can't you can't you can't dress well you can

**[30:42 - 30:44]** You're looking too good you got to

**[30:45 - 30:46]** Wear

**[30:46 - 30:48]** Certain types of clothes you got to

**[30:49 - 30:51]** You got to pray

**[30:51 - 30:53]** 3 a.m. Every morning

**[30:54 - 30:59]** You got to engage in

**[31:00 - 31:02]** Some of these other mystical things

**[31:04 - 31:05]** Uh

**[31:05 - 31:09]** You got to understand the complexity of the spiritual world and

**[31:09 - 31:14]** Principle of his and powers and how to deal with this one and how to deal with that one

**[31:15 - 31:20]** You got to know that and they begin to bring all of these other things

**[31:21 - 31:23]** And at the end of the day

**[31:23 - 31:25]** You're no longer looking to Christ. You no longer feel

**[31:26 - 31:28]** in him

**[31:28 - 31:31]** You know you hear me you no longer feel that

**[31:32 - 31:36]** That your relationship with Jesus Christ your faith in him

**[31:36 - 31:43]** For who he is and what he accomplished is sufficient the fact that he is your light is sufficient

**[31:44 - 31:46]** You lose that

**[31:46 - 31:48]** confidence

**[31:49 - 31:53]** In Christ and in his efficiency and you start looking

**[31:54 - 31:56]** For what you already have

**[31:56 - 31:58]** In all of these other things

**[31:58 - 32:03]** That you're being told you got to do and then you sit there and say that's deep

**[32:06 - 32:09]** Yeah, I don't I don't want to go to harvest anymore get it y'all they talk about his grace

**[32:12 - 32:15]** Preva we talk about grace because grace points you right to Jesus

**[32:15 - 32:24]** It the day you lose the day you lose the revelation of the grace of God you cannot live the higher life

**[32:24 - 32:26]** We're talking about oh you may have all of these

**[32:27 - 32:31]** These streams and all the stuff where you go to hell and you come back and

**[32:33 - 32:35]** I don't know how much of that hasn't a truth in it

**[32:36 - 32:38]** Are you understanding me but here's the bottom line

**[32:39 - 32:41]** anything

**[32:41 - 32:42]** anyone

**[32:42 - 32:44]** any experience

**[32:44 - 32:46]** that takes your mind

**[32:47 - 32:49]** away

**[32:49 - 32:51]** from Christ

**[32:51 - 32:53]** as

**[32:53 - 32:55]** the one in whom

**[32:56 - 32:57]** You live

**[32:57 - 33:02]** The one who is the source of your life and therefore makes you complete

**[33:03 - 33:07]** Any revelation no matter how deep it sounds

**[33:08 - 33:10]** No matter how many stories they got your

**[33:11 - 33:13]** Back it up

**[33:13 - 33:15]** It takes your mind of

**[33:15 - 33:18]** Of a Christ and it has you looking elsewhere

**[33:18 - 33:23]** Or looking for more because somehow Christ

**[33:23 - 33:25]** Himself alone is not enough

**[33:27 - 33:29]** Any of that is from the enemy

**[33:30 - 33:34]** and the design and intention is to break

**[33:35 - 33:43]** Your focus on Christ and what will result will not be the life God has called you

**[33:45 - 33:50]** to live all right

**[33:51 - 33:53]** Say I am in Christ

**[33:54 - 33:56]** In whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells

**[33:58 - 34:00]** I'm living

**[34:00 - 34:04]** smack in the middle of divinity

**[34:05 - 34:07]** Everything I need

**[34:08 - 34:10]** is located

**[34:10 - 34:12]** Inside of him

**[34:13 - 34:15]** Anything not in him

**[34:15 - 34:27]** Is not anything I need

**[34:27 - 34:29]** Hallelujah

**[34:29 - 34:31]** You know again if it were to read

**[34:31 - 34:34]** Colossians chapter one

**[34:34 - 34:37]** Paul gave thanks in that chapter

**[34:38 - 34:40]** for the fruit

**[34:40 - 34:46]** That the gospel was producing he said all over the world

**[34:46 - 34:48]** The gospel was producing fruit

**[34:49 - 34:56]** And he was giving God thanks and the evidence of that was in the Colossian church because he gave

**[34:56 - 34:58]** He saw their faith in Christ's glory

**[34:58 - 35:04]** He saw their love for one another increase and he saw them being steadfast in hope going through tests and trials

**[35:04 - 35:06]** And he says this is the fruit of the gospel

**[35:07 - 35:10]** He says this gospel is producing fruit all over the world

**[35:11 - 35:15]** Inside of people you know, there was people's lives were being transformed

**[35:16 - 35:19]** By this gospel and he tells you exactly in Colossians when he says

**[35:20 - 35:24]** In this gospel it tells you about the grace of God

**[35:25 - 35:33]** So this gospel that tells you about the grace of God was producing fruit in people all over the world

**[35:34 - 35:38]** In the Colossians church it was producing fruit and Paul was giving thanks, but then

**[35:39 - 35:46]** Immediately after saying how thankful he was for the fruit that he saw and the good things that was happening in this church

**[35:47 - 35:48]** He said and I pray

**[35:50 - 35:52]** I pray for you all the time

**[35:52 - 35:56]** I pray for you that God will give you strength

**[35:57 - 35:59]** I pray for you that you will get understanding

**[36:00 - 36:04]** I pray for you that you will be steadfast

**[36:05 - 36:06]** He immediately

**[36:07 - 36:13]** After praising God for the wonderful growth he saw happening in this church

**[36:14 - 36:20]** Which was the result of the gospel of grace that he will have been caring and

**[36:21 - 36:22]** responding to

**[36:22 - 36:24]** He immediately

**[36:24 - 36:28]** Says and for this reason I'm praying for you all the all the time

**[36:28 - 36:31]** And you know what I heard that I said what I mean it usually if

**[36:32 - 36:34]** If people are doing well spiritually

**[36:35 - 36:42]** If they're growing in their faith in Christ they're growing in their love for one another they're growing in their

**[36:43 - 36:44]** That they hope

**[36:44 - 36:46]** Why is Paul

**[36:47 - 36:50]** So concerned that he's praying for them so much. I would think you pray for

**[36:51 - 36:53]** The ones who are struggling

**[36:54 - 36:58]** But here Paul is saying praying for the ones who are doing well because for understood

**[36:59 - 37:03]** That these people who are doing well live in an environment

**[37:04 - 37:09]** Where they are going to be exposed to all kinds of things

**[37:10 - 37:12]** That could threaten their very faith in Christ

**[37:13 - 37:15]** And so he understood that

**[37:15 - 37:17]** In the enemy

**[37:17 - 37:21]** Doesn't want you and me to live this higher life

**[37:22 - 37:28]** And so when he sees us living this higher life from the revelation of our identity in Christ

**[37:29 - 37:39]** He will do whatever he can to try to interrupt that and to keep us from maintaining our focus on Christ

**[37:41 - 37:43]** And for that we have to pray

**[37:44 - 37:46]** so that

**[37:46 - 37:48]** Those who are

**[37:48 - 37:50]** Living the higher life

**[37:50 - 37:52]** Will continue to live in the

**[37:52 - 37:58]** The higher life those who are focusing on Christ will continue to focus on Christ

**[37:58 - 38:02]** That they will not be distracted by circumstances or by philosophies

**[38:03 - 38:10]** By all of these new age religions and by all the kinds of things that you hear that the enemy constantly throws at us

**[38:11 - 38:14]** Hoping that if this doesn't work this will work if that doesn't work

**[38:15 - 38:20]** This will work that at some point we will listen to some lie embrace some lie

**[38:21 - 38:23]** And take our focus over Jesus

**[38:24 - 38:27]** So to ensure that people who are already

**[38:28 - 38:31]** Growing continue to grow process. I'm going to keep praying

**[38:32 - 38:38]** I'm going to keep praying for them so that nothing the enemy tries to do to distract them from Jesus will succeed

**[38:39 - 38:40]** Amen

**[38:40 - 38:44]** So one of the things we need to do church as a church is pray for one another

**[38:45 - 38:51]** Pray for ourselves and pray for one another that in the midst of all that we are exposed to here

**[38:52 - 38:55]** I mean and through the internet through television through our

**[38:56 - 38:57]** schools

**[38:57 - 39:01]** I mean everywhere we go you have these philosophies these these false ideas

**[39:01 - 39:08]** traditions of men and and and and all of these things that are being taught that are not according to Christ

**[39:08 - 39:14]** That's a lot of spiritual warfare that is taking place to control your thoughts and minds and the ultimate goal

**[39:14 - 39:21]** Is to take your mind away from Jesus present an alternative to Jesus even disguised it as though is Jesus

**[39:21 - 39:24]** But it's not Jesus because if he can disconnect

**[39:25 - 39:31]** Your minds from its focus on Christ. It's like that light bulb that has been disconnected

**[39:32 - 39:36]** from the source

**[39:36 - 39:38]** All right

**[39:38 - 39:43]** All right, so quickly let's let's let me let me let me let me and Paul go back to Colossians 31 and we're going to end now

**[39:44 - 39:50]** If you are raised with Christ

**[39:50 - 39:52]** seek those things

**[39:52 - 39:54]** which are above

**[39:54 - 39:57]** where Christ is

**[39:57 - 39:59]** sitting at the right hand of God

**[40:02 - 40:04]** Set your mind on things above not on things on the earth

**[40:05 - 40:11]** For you died and your light is hit so since you are risen to Christ say since

**[40:12 - 40:17]** Not if as though it didn't happen in however, this is a reality

**[40:18 - 40:20]** insolvation

**[40:20 - 40:22]** you ascended

**[40:23 - 40:25]** That's why you can live the higher life

**[40:26 - 40:30]** because you have ascended with Christ spiritually

**[40:31 - 40:35]** Christ

**[40:35 - 40:37]** When he arose

**[40:37 - 40:40]** You arose in him when he ascended

**[40:41 - 40:43]** You ascended in him

**[40:44 - 40:46]** where Christ is

**[40:47 - 40:49]** You are

**[40:49 - 40:51]** So seek the things which are

**[40:52 - 40:54]** above

**[40:54 - 40:58]** For two reasons again the things which are above are

**[40:59 - 41:01]** Betta and then secondly

**[41:02 - 41:08]** Above is actually where you now live that is your address

**[41:09 - 41:11]** Yes

**[41:11 - 41:14]** Spiritually you got to understand your spirit

**[41:15 - 41:16]** lives

**[41:16 - 41:18]** In this place we're calling above

**[41:19 - 41:21]** That's why you live

**[41:21 - 41:23]** That's why you're living

**[41:23 - 41:27]** Then why would you be seeking things on earth

**[41:30 - 41:33]** All of us are not living where in the United States

**[41:34 - 41:36]** Because you're in the United States

**[41:37 - 41:39]** What do you naturally seek

**[41:39 - 41:41]** Things that are where you live

**[41:43 - 41:45]** if you are in

**[41:47 - 41:49]** Nigeria

**[41:49 - 41:51]** And you needed to go to the hospital

**[41:51 - 41:55]** You will have to seek a hospital in Nigeria

**[41:56 - 41:58]** Because that's where you live

**[41:59 - 42:04]** If you're in the US and you want to seek a hospital

**[42:05 - 42:07]** You got a lot of good hospitals here

**[42:08 - 42:11]** Why not take advantage of the many good hospitals here

**[42:12 - 42:14]** And find a good hospital right where you are

**[42:15 - 42:16]** Because you're where the hospitals are

**[42:18 - 42:21]** If you're here

**[42:21 - 42:23]** Why would you go to Liberia

**[42:24 - 42:30]** To seek medical here

**[42:30 - 42:31]** That's my country now your own life

**[42:35 - 42:37]** Nobody here in that right mind

**[42:37 - 42:38]** I think

**[42:38 - 42:40]** Would be in the United States

**[42:40 - 42:41]** America where you have the best hospital

**[42:41 - 42:42]** The best doctors

**[42:42 - 42:43]** And you got really ill

**[42:43 - 42:46]** He said oh, I'm going to Liberia as a JFK

**[42:49 - 42:52]** No, no, no, no, if you are here

**[42:53 - 42:55]** You know you are here where the best hospitals are

**[42:56 - 42:59]** You're gonna spend your time seeking the best hospitals

**[42:59 - 43:01]** Because where you are the best hospitals are

**[43:01 - 43:03]** You follow the illustration

**[43:03 - 43:04]** This is where you are

**[43:05 - 43:08]** And the things here are far better than the things here

**[43:08 - 43:11]** Why be here and seeking things here

**[43:15 - 43:17]** Why being Christ where the

**[43:17 - 43:19]** Everything that is of God is

**[43:20 - 43:24]** And instead of seeking the things that are of God where you are

**[43:24 - 43:26]** You leave those things to come and seek

**[43:27 - 43:32]** earthly things

**[43:32 - 43:34]** So go ahead

**[43:34 - 43:36]** If you're going to live the higher life

**[43:36 - 43:38]** Make this decision

**[43:38 - 43:41]** I'm going to seek the things which are above first because they are better second

**[43:41 - 43:42]** That's why I am

**[43:42 - 43:44]** That means I have access

**[43:46 - 43:47]** To God

**[43:47 - 43:51]** I have access to all God is all God has

**[43:51 - 43:52]** All God can do

**[43:53 - 43:57]** I'm actually there where all of those things are available in Christ

**[43:58 - 44:00]** And so that's what I am going to be seeking

**[44:04 - 44:07]** Then he says set your mind on things which are above

**[44:09 - 44:10]** Again

**[44:10 - 44:17]** The whole intention of the enemy in his strategy is to get your mind off of things which are above

**[44:17 - 44:21]** To give you a reason to want to focus on things on earth

**[44:21 - 44:22]** But that is a strategy

**[44:23 - 44:25]** He cannot undo what Christ has done

**[44:25 - 44:27]** But if he can get you to focus here

**[44:27 - 44:30]** He can render you powerless

**[44:30 - 44:32]** Because you're no longer focusing on the source

**[44:33 - 44:34]** So here'll be

**[44:34 - 44:35]** Make a decision

**[44:35 - 44:38]** You're going to set your mind on Christ

**[44:38 - 44:40]** And on the things that belong to him

**[46:10 - 46:12]** Life is completing him

**[46:13 - 46:14]** Everything he is I am

**[46:14 - 46:15]** Everything he has I have

**[46:17 - 46:19]** Things don't look good right now

**[46:20 - 46:21]** But I'm living from above

**[46:26 - 46:28]** You can change the channel

**[46:29 - 46:30]** With your mouth

**[46:31 - 46:32]** Remember this

**[46:32 - 46:33]** And my mouth

**[46:33 - 46:35]** Is the remote control

**[46:35 - 46:37]** That God has given me

**[46:37 - 46:39]** To change the channel

**[46:39 - 46:40]** That my mind

**[46:41 - 46:42]** Is dwelling on

**[46:42 - 46:43]** And what we want to do

**[46:43 - 46:45]** Is to set our mind on things

**[46:46 - 46:48]** above

**[46:48 - 46:50]** And then he says he says

**[46:50 - 46:51]** Modify the deeds

**[46:52 - 46:54]** Of the flesh now

**[46:54 - 46:59]** I promise you I'm ending

**[46:59 - 47:01]** But there are a lot of stuff

**[47:01 - 47:02]** That we are still doing

**[47:02 - 47:04]** We shouldn't be doing

**[47:04 - 47:07]** Fondication, adultery, lying, anger,

**[47:07 - 47:10]** Jealousy, covetousness, idolatry

**[47:11 - 47:12]** Bad mouthing people

**[47:13 - 47:15]** Cussing

**[47:15 - 47:17]** And on and on and on

**[47:18 - 47:19]** You lived in those things before you

**[47:19 - 47:21]** Became a Christian that was your nature

**[47:22 - 47:24]** Now that is no longer your nature

**[47:25 - 47:27]** So God says

**[47:27 - 47:27]** Modify

**[47:27 - 47:30]** But the deeds of the flesh

**[47:31 - 47:33]** To death

**[47:33 - 47:35]** Now notice you didn't say

**[47:35 - 47:37]** Crucify yourself

**[47:37 - 47:40]** Because you that old man that need to be crucified

**[47:40 - 47:41]** Is already dead

**[47:42 - 47:44]** What he says is

**[47:44 - 47:46]** That old man that is dead

**[47:47 - 47:49]** Left some things behind

**[47:53 - 47:55]** And those things don't belong to the new man

**[47:56 - 47:59]** So take those things to old man left behind in your mind

**[48:01 - 48:03]** And discard them

**[48:04 - 48:05]** They no longer belong to the new man

**[48:10 - 48:11]** There's a house

**[48:13 - 48:15]** On the house on the outside is nice

**[48:16 - 48:18]** But the man who lives there was dirty

**[48:20 - 48:22]** And so the house had a lot of

**[48:23 - 48:25]** Dirt the coffees were dirty

**[48:25 - 48:27]** The walls had a lot of dirt on it

**[48:27 - 48:29]** The furniture were all old and

**[48:31 - 48:32]** And just out of date

**[48:33 - 48:34]** And you buy the house

**[48:35 - 48:37]** Because the old man that lived there died

**[48:38 - 48:39]** And so the house was sold

**[48:40 - 48:41]** You bought the house

**[48:41 - 48:42]** And you moved in

**[48:43 - 48:44]** Are you the old man

**[48:46 - 48:49]** Your new man and this new man is very clean

**[48:50 - 48:52]** This new man doesn't like dirt

**[48:55 - 48:58]** He wants everything in order. He doesn't like confusion

**[48:59 - 49:01]** He moved in the house that he bought

**[49:02 - 49:05]** The old man is no longer dead because the old man died

**[49:06 - 49:08]** That old man that lived in sin

**[49:09 - 49:12]** That you once were on the cross

**[49:13 - 49:15]** In fact, I shouldn't just say die, God put him to death

**[49:16 - 49:19]** He was executed with Christ on the cross

**[49:19 - 49:21]** He no longer lives there

**[49:22 - 49:24]** So you move into the house where he once lived

**[49:25 - 49:26]** And you look around

**[49:28 - 49:30]** And he used to smoke a lot too

**[49:31 - 49:35]** So you got to smell a nicotine there

**[49:36 - 49:37]** You follow me you got

**[49:37 - 49:38]** So what do you do

**[49:39 - 49:41]** Do you say oh well, I'm just going to live here

**[49:43 - 49:44]** Are you going to be comfortable there

**[49:45 - 49:47]** Are you going to accept that

**[49:47 - 49:51]** What are you going to do the first thing you're going to do is we got to clean this place

**[49:53 - 49:57]** And you begin to take all of the furniture that belong to the old man that no longer belongs to you say

**[49:58 - 49:59]** There's a new person living here

**[50:00 - 50:01]** You and me we don't agree

**[50:01 - 50:03]** We are not in agreement

**[50:03 - 50:06]** So you begin to discard all of that stuff

**[50:06 - 50:08]** Fornication you got to go

**[50:09 - 50:10]** Adopted

**[50:12 - 50:13]** Lying

**[50:13 - 50:14]** No

**[50:15 - 50:16]** Envent no

**[50:17 - 50:20]** Gossip

**[50:20 - 50:26]** Glutiny

**[50:26 - 50:27]** And one by one

**[50:28 - 50:31]** You dismisses you know you know no that's not who I am

**[50:32 - 50:35]** This is who I am your new identity. I'm not a chicken

**[50:35 - 50:37]** Even from the dust

**[50:37 - 50:40]** On worms I'm an eagle with wings

**[50:40 - 50:41]** And I'm sorry

**[50:41 - 50:45]** So you no longer you are no longer compatible

**[50:45 - 50:50]** I'm going to stop putting all of these things out of my life to make room for the new

**[50:50 - 50:53]** So he says

**[50:53 - 50:59]** Modify put out these things, but then he says also put on so you throw these things out

**[50:59 - 51:05]** And then you just kind of you start to bring in the things from Christ the things which are above and you start to

**[51:06 - 51:09]** Move them into your mind and into your life

**[51:11 - 51:13]** Do you hear me

**[51:13 - 51:18]** Father I pray that the Holy Spirit will take what we have taught and by your power

**[51:18 - 51:20]** Help us to

**[51:20 - 51:22]** Live this higher life

**[51:22 - 51:24]** That we're called to live

**[51:24 - 51:26]** In Jesus name

**[51:27 - 51:29]** Amen, okay, well God bless you

**[51:37 - 51:40]** All right, everybody shall say the higher life

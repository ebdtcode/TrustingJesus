 Father, we thank you for this wonderful day, this new year, this first Sunday that you've allowed us to see and to gather as your people. We thank you for the presence of the Holy Spirit and for the minister of the Holy Spirit in revealing Christ to us. We believe even now and expect Him to give revelation through us and to give understanding to us in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, we introduce our theme for the year on on on on on watch night and is on the on the wall there. 2026 is our year of our year of what? Now, now what is not there, but what is implied is this is a year of God's unfilling love. Amen. So whenever you say unfilling love is okay to say, God's unfilling love or understand that we're referring to God's unfailing love. Say Hallelujah. So one more time say 2026, our year of God's unfailing love, God's love is not going to fail. And on on again, on watch night, we told you a number of things about that love that I again, I pray that you would take the time to listen to one of the things we stress was that that love is everlasting. Amen. It has no beginning, it has no end. There's not a day when God didn't love and there's never going to be a day when does God doesn't love. And one thing you can count on that is going to be consistent throughout 2026. There'll be a lot of things changing, but one thing that would never change is how much God loves you. Amen. Regardless of what you do or don't do and you need to do right because there are consequences and those consequences many times are the result of just they happen because you so a seed you reap. But they don't change God's love. Are you hear me? And the purpose of God's word and God's instruction and his guidance is because he knows what's best. Amen. And so it's in our interests always do what God says is in our interests of our family. It's in the interests of the world for us obey God. But please don't tie God's love to your performance because God loved you before you were born God loved you before you were saved. Love you love to give his son to die for you. That is consistent. Let your life be built on that. When you're obeying and doing what God would have you to do. Let that be grounded on this revelation. God loves me. And when you start acting the fool God forbid that you should but knowing that God loves you is the foundation that will bring you back. I hear me keep what but he loves me because that's one of the things that God said to Israel is doing their rebellion and disobedience and says but I have always loved you. Even when you were messing up and some of you need to hear that right now because some of you are messing up. You're doing things you know you shouldn't be doing your in places you shouldn't be you know that but I'm going to remind you all year that God loves you with an everlasting love. Now how do you respond to that kind of love? Do you say because you love now when go and continue to offend you? That's not how people think especially the born again people. You're born again. You don't think that way. Amen. When you're reminded of how much God loves you. If you're born again you realize I can't continue to offend him like this. I can't continue to disobey him. He loves me when I everlasting love. And then you turn and you respond and he's there ready to continue to love you. Amen. That's bills on that. And throughout this year we pray that God will increasingly give us understanding by his spirit of this everlasting love because Paul in his epistle on the Ephesians when he was praying for the believers he would pray always that they would know the love of God that passes all understanding. Otherwise we're going to spend eternity getting to know how much God loves us. He says but I pray that you would know the love of God the lack the breath the height the depth of God's love so that you may be feels with all the fullness of God. All of us want to be full of God. Where the way to get full of God is to know how much God loves you. Amen. And so the more we know the love of God the more we're able to experience the fullness of his spirit which means the Holy Spirit begins to control the direct our decisions and our activities more more as we grow in the love of God. So if you're not being spirit led if you're not following the spirit of you that just points to one thing you don't know how much God loves you. You can say God loves me but you don't have a revelation because the more you truly understand the love of God the more you yield to that love the more you yield to him. And the more he can manifest his nature through you. In Jesus name. Hallelujah. Say God's love is everlasting. Now what I want to show you today is that God's love is this unstoppable power that is behind God's will. And faith is the God given mechanism by which the power of God. The power of God's love is received and released in our lives. You know a lot of us have a view of God's love as a view of love as simply being some passive sentiment. A gentle emotion. Near kindness, good thoughts. And that's how we think of love but the Bible reveals to us that love God's love is the strongest force in existence. And that's a renewal of the mind that we need to engage in where we stop thinking of God's love simply as sentiment. Passive emotions something God feels and we begin to understand the love of God as the greatest and most powerful force in the universe. The Bible tells us a room of chapter 8 nothing can separate you from the love of God and if God is for you, wish me God's God loves you. Who what can be against you and when? You hear me? Said your neighbor God's love is the strongest force in the universe. In fact the Bible says you press Corinthians in the chapter chapter 13 Paul says love God's love never fails. Now is that anything that you know that is created and never fails? But God's love never fails which means God's love is almighty. You hear me? Which means God's love is as strong as God himself. And that shouldn't be hard to believe because the Bible says God is love. Say hallelujah. So everything else can fail but God's love cannot. The power of God's love cannot fail. God's love for you cannot fail. God's love for me. God love God's love for us cannot fail. It is as strong as God himself. Hallelujah. Everything else can fail. Knowledge can fail. People can fail. Money, even money. I know some of you live for it. But even money can fail. They're just some things money cannot do. One thing money should it cannot do. It cannot save your soul. You can gain the whole world and lose your soul. And if you hear this morning you haven't received Jesus as your Lord and savior but you're so committed to making as much money as possible. Remember money cannot save your soul. And the most valuable thing you possess is your soul. Far more important than your body. Thank God for our bodies for the soul is eternal. Hallelujah. And you don't want to be like the rich man who you know both sit up all his achievements and then the Lord sets a hint tonight. Your soul will be required of you. So money can fail. It's certainly will fail you when it comes to eternal things. And those who love you humanly speaking and there's something. Thank God for human love. Even that can fail. Here's the one thing we're going to 2000 and 26 with God's love cannot fail. Why? Because God's love is God in action. God's love is God. Acting in your behalf and if God cannot feel his love cannot feel that you hear me turn to your neighbor said God's love cannot fail because God loving me. It's God. Acting on my behalf. Love is not passive love is action love is something you do. So when you say God loves you or God loves me this is what you're saying you're saying God is eternally committed to always using his power in my interest and for my good. God loves me God means God is using his power for my good and in my interest continually. You're not you all are not saying even on this side. I don't want you to go in 2000 26 out of God's love and I don't want you to go in 2000 to think God's love is just an emotion a sentiment. No when God says I love you on the Bible says God loves you saying God is acting. You hear me God is using his power always for your good always in your interest. How does it feels to know that right now all my God is using his almighty power for your good in your interest. Oh that's what Paul asked the question if God be for me if God be for you if God is using his power on your behalf in your interest because God loves you then who what can be against you didn't say things will be against you but what can be against you and when. That thing has to be strong enough to overcome the love of God and the last time I check even the grave couldn't keep the love of God bound because the love of God overcame death and death is the strongest force in opposition to God yet the love of God overcomes. So what is it that you and I are facing that God's love cannot overcome I like to say has already overcome because I consider that victory on the cross the resurrection as the victory that has overcome all evil. I hear me so if God's love is as powerful as God himself and if God's love for you is almighty then there's no other power at work in the world today that can prevent God's love from accomplishing God's will for you. If the love of God is so powerful that it cannot fail then logically means there's no obstacle that you're facing no problem that you're confronting no challenge you're dealing with right now in your life that is strong enough to prevent the love of God from accomplishing the will of God for you. Go ahead open your mouth and say amen and if we have time I will tell you why that's important that you do that. Hello there one more time open your mouth and say amen when you say amen you're agreeing with the truth it's important that we agree with truth and throughout 2016 we want to agree with the truth that God loves us and this love is unstoppable this love is all powerful this love is almighty and there's no other way. There's no other way and there's nothing that is at work against us that can reveal or overcome the power of God's love so no matter what we're going through it will more than conquer through Christ who loved us. The love of God makes us more than conquer us how many you feel you're more than a conqueror. How many of you don't feel you're more than a conqueror. It doesn't matter whether you feel it or not because being more than a conqueror is not based on your feeling it's based upon God's love. It's not your feeling that makes you more than a conqueror you might get up in the morning and feel so terrible. It's not your feelings that make you more than a conqueror it's the love of God and no matter how you feel the love of God is constant and God is still working say hallelujah. We're going to arm ourselves with truth we're going to go in 2016 relying on believing on this all powerful all mighty force that is at work on our behalf called the call the love of God and we're going to know that every problem every challenge every difficult every obstacle is subject to that love. Hallelujah. Say after me saying all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. Notice Paul didn't say you're more than a conqueror through self effort you're more than a conqueror based upon strategy he said you're more than conquerors because of God's love for you. We conquer true love God's love is greater the same cost Love is greater to demons God's love is greater to failure God's love is greater to trends God's love is greater than your past God's love is greater than your future God's love is greater than your present God's love is greater than you. God's love is greater than principalities and powers. God's love is greater than witches and witch doctors. God's love is greater than curses. God's love is great up and nothing compares with the love of God. If you agree with me, say, amen. So this is the title of my sermon. Love and faith, heaven's dynamic duo. Say love and faith, heaven's dynamic duo. Both love and faith, I give God gives us both unnecessary. Amen. We have said a lot about the power of God's love and we will be meditating on the love of God all year because we want our understanding of this love to increase so that our faith in this love can also increase. Because you see, love, God's love, and our faith work together to accomplish God's will. Love is all mighty force that is given to us. Love is power of God that bless us and provides for everything we need. Love that is invincible, that is available, that is providing. This love must be believed, received, and released. You hear me? It must be what? Believed, received, and it's not hard to do that. Don't think that, oh, there's a whole, you know, now, okay, we're back to the Ten Commandments. No, the Bible says God made it by faith so it can be easy for anybody. Come on, say faith is not hard. Faith is actually arrest. Faith is actually arrest. Why faith needs this understanding and revelation? When it gets revelation, it's not hard. If faith is hard, then it's not faith. Faith is not striving. Faith is actually relaxing. Resting in the love of God. And the great our unison of God's love, the more rest, we experience, and that rest is actually produced by faith. Are you here? Yes. Amen. So this power is available, but there's a dynamic duel here. The love of God is the power of God that is providing. Continually everything we need, but that love, the power of that love must be believed, must be received, and then must be released. And this is where the second member of the dynamic duel comes in, faith, because faith is that mechanism that believes, receives that love, and then releases it. And how does faith come by hearing? That's why I'm having you listen. I'm having you hearing, and I'm having you repeating, and I'm having you say, because that's how faith is activated. You don't want to be passive when it comes to the revelation concerning God's love. You want to be active in responding to the revelation. You want to be active in hearing. You want to be active in responding, because faith is released when you respond to the revelation of God's love. And that faith that is released in response to the revelation of God's love becomes the mechanism that allows that love to be manifested fully in your life, so that you are able to walk in it in greater ways. Raise your hand and say, thank God, for God's love, and God's faith. Faith is also a gift from Him. Now Jesus, and scriptures were often, say, as Jesus said, according to your faith, be it unto you. Now, it's not because it's hard to receive from God. It's not because God is withholding His love when Jesus says, according to your faith, the reason He's pointing to faith, because faith aligns us with what love is already doing. Faith doesn't make God do anything. Love has already caused God to do everything. For God so loved the world that He did what gave His only big, what more does He need to do that He has not already done in giving the Son? And so Paul says, in Him we are complete. God's love caused God to give Jesus, and in Jesus God did everything needed. He supplied all our needs, according to His richest in glory, in Christ Jesus. So the gifts of the Son is the gifts of God's answer to our prayers. That's Jesus's love's answer to our prayers. Jesus is love's supply to our needs. Jesus is Lord's love's healing for our lives. And all of that is the act of God's love. That was completely independent of you. The love of God has already made you rich. The Bible says we're rich. Bless will all spiritual, richest, in heavenly places. All means all. In every dimension we have more than enough to do what God has called us to do in Christ Jesus. Come and say to your neighbor, love has already supplied you with all that you need. And more than you need to do the will of God, accomplish the purpose of God in Christ Jesus. You lack nothing in Jesus. Love never fails. There is no shortage. Say, love never fails. The provision is there already. Faith is how we receive that provision and releases so that we can experience it. Fully in our lives and we can be channels by which it flows through us to others. Hallelujah. So when Jesus is according to your faith be unto you, he's simply saying faith is important, not because love hasn't provided. But faith is how you get into alignment with what love has already done or what love is doing. You don't use faith to get love to do something. Love doesn't need to be motivated. Love does not need to be impressed. Are you hearing me? God's love doesn't need to be impressed. God is love and He loves you. I told you the other day that love can't go get bigger, it can't get and won't get smaller. It's constant. But God doesn't need you to motivate Him. So faith is not to move God. Faith is for moving you. What faith does is faith brings you into alignment with what love has done or love has already done. And when you come into alignment with what love has done or love has done, you experience the benefits of that love. Let me give you two examples. If you came into the house and you were very, very thirsty, you've been working in the yard and you come into the house and you're very thirsty and there's a faucet and the faucet has actually turned on and there's clean, cool water that is already flowing. That water is the solution to your need. That water is what you need to question your thirds. It's already flowing through the faucet in abundance far more than you need. Well, what do you do? You don't just look at it. You said there is where it is and you get a cup and you move the cup from the cupboard and you bring it into alignment. You move the cup from where the cupboard, because what you want, you want that water. So you move the cup from where the cupboard and you bring it into alignment with where the water, the love is already flowing and because you've moved it into alignment, the cup becomes full of the water that was already flowing and you can then drink that water and your need is met. Or if you don't have a cup, maybe this might be even better, you go to where the thing there and you put your mouth, where the water is already flowing and that water enters you and your thirst is quenched. You need to put your mouth. That's what we need to do in 2006. The love is already flowing in abundance, love that was satisfy every day. I, are you hear me? And all that is needed is faith. And what faith is putting your mouth. Where love is already flowing. Say hallelujah. And every one of us know where love is flowing, love is flowing in Jesus. I said love is flowing in Jesus. So I'm going to take my mouth and I'm going to put my mouth where Jesus is. Are you hear me? I'm going to take my mouth and I'm going to fill my mouth with Jesus. I'm going to fill my mouth where Jesus is, where the blessings are. I'm going to declare who Jesus is. I'm going to declare what Jesus has done. I'm going to declare who I am in Him. I'm going to declare that He's my righteousness. I'm going to declare He's my sanctification, my wisdom. I'm going to declare He's my supply, He's my healing, He's my deliverance. Are you hear me? He's my protection. I am going to declare He's my all and all. My keeper, my help, my supply for all my needs. I'm putting my mouth where Jesus is. I'm getting my mouth in alignment with Him and that love that is in Him for me will flow to me, in me and through me. But it's important that I get the cup out of the cupboard and place it under the flow. It's important that you get your mouth off of your neighbor. Get your mouth off of your brother, your sister. Get your mouth where the love of God is flowing and working in the name of Jesus. And once you get your mouth where the love of God is in Christ Jesus, you start to experience the power of that love. Are you hear me? So this love that provides and cannot be stopped, it's available. You don't have to produce it. You don't have to earn it. You don't have to work for it. It's already a provided and it's constantly flowing. I told you God's love does not take a break, does it take vacations? It's constantly flowing in Christ Jesus. Faith is the mechanism that brings you into alignment with that love. And so faith, faith must be activated so that you receive and release that love. And what are we saying? It's faith is the way you get into alignment. How do you activate that faith? Well, how are they suggested? It involves, when I re-script you, I see two things that are clear to me that activate or move us. Into alignment by faith with the love of God so that we're able to experience that love in its fullness. Firstly, the Bible says faith works by love. Or we can see it is where faith is activated by love. Amen? God's love is what? His commitment to always use his power for our good in our interests. That's the love of God. And is that love that calls God to give? It's only be gotten some because love gives love serves. Love sacrifices. That's the nature of God's love. And the scripture says faith is activated by love. So when we begin to walk in love ourselves, we activate faith because that actually brings us in alignment with the love of God. When I am walking in love, choosing to do so, I am what? Brinking myself in alignment with the love of God. And hear me. James says, I will show you my faith by my works. I will show you my faith, huh? By my works. So my works will activate my faith. But when you read James, he's done what works of love. And I will show you my faith by my works of love. So it gives faith is being activated by works of love. Jesus said, give. That's what love does. And it shall be what? So when you do what love does, you give, you activate God's love. People's love. Some of you were praying for me just now. You got it? So one of the ways I align myself with the love of God, I put myself where the love is flowing, is by making the decision that I am going to walk in love. Because when I choose to walk in love, I'm actually activating the power of faith that allows me to receive and release that love. So one way church, you and I as individuals and we as a church, will activate or align ourselves with God's love, is by ourselves choosing to operate. And when we are operating love, choosing to give, choosing to serve, choosing to sacrifice, to support God's work on behalf of others, we are aligning ourselves where love is already flowing. And when we do so, we will begin to experience the love of God in greater and greater measures. So open your mouth and say, I shall align myself with the love of God by choosing to walk in love myself in Jesus' name. Here's the second thing I see. And this is very clear in Scripture. The Bible says, Paul was speaking and Paul was talking to the Corinthian Christians and Paul talked about how they were going through all this persecution and all the challenges and all the difficulties as apostles. And the people themselves were not experiencing the level of persecution that he was experiencing. And all that he was going through it, he called all that he was going through. And everybody said amen, join with us and say amen. One more time, say hallelujah. She's helping me to make my point, I will make my point, that's an example. So, so listen to me. So Paul was talking to all of us and saying, you guys right now you're doing well. I mean, you're enjoying the life of Christ. I mean, everything is, you know, you guys, but we apostles, he says, we're constantly being delivered over the death for Jesus to say. And he says, we are experiencing death for Jesus to sick in order that the life of Christ might be manifested in us. In other words, we go through trials, we go through tests. And when we're going through all the pressures that come against us, that can be characterized as the sufferings of the deaths that Christ went through. But he says, we go through that, show that the life of Christ can manifest. So if you're dealing with sickness, that's death. But healing is the manifestation of life. If you're facing financial pressures right now, Paul said, it's so that the life of Christ provision can be manifested. I hear me. In other words, what you're going through is not final. It's simply an opportunity for the life of Christ to be manifested in that situation. And after saying that, Paul said, we too, we have the same spirit of faith. We believe, therefore we speak. And what Paul was saying, I believe that the life of Christ shall indeed be manifested. And this life, this death I'm experiencing right now, shall be overcome when the life of Christ is manifested in my mortal body. Therefore, since I believe this, I will speak it. In other words, Paul is saying, the life of Christ will manifest. I know it will. I believe it, but now I must speak it. And he said, that's the spirit of faith. So the way you activate faith so that you can experience the life of Christ being manifested in your situation is not only by believing in your heart, but opening your mouth and speaking. The Bible says in Romans chapter 10, from 8 to 10, the way we're saying is we confess, we open our mouth and we speak. And that what we believe, and when we speak what we believe in our hearts, we are saved. So the spirit of faith says, we believe in our hearts and we want speak with our mouths. Jesus said, whosoever shall say to this mountain, be thou removed and shall not die in his heart. But shall believe those things which he says shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever. He says, we believe, therefore we speak. So I align myself with the love of God, but acts of love and by declaring with my mouth what love has done. What love can do. What love will do. It is by speaking that will activate my faith that brings me in alignment with what love has done and love is done. And when I come in alignment, I make my confession. That love at this and work that power that is invincible is able to manifest God's will in my life in that area. I know you've heard this. That is a new, but are you doing it? He didn't say, if you think or if you just silently consent, he didn't say if you just nod your head. He's very specific. I believe, therefore I speak. If you believe in your heart and you confess with your mouth, if you say to this mountain, this is spiritual law. It meant God is telling us something that we need to take hold of that the way you align yourself with the power of God's love is connected to your mouth. Your mouth was not given to you primarily to eat with. We use our mouth for to eat. That's that. Listen to me. Thank God for the delicious food. But God gave you your voice in order to activate the covenant. God gave you your voice to activate the power of his love. That's the primary purpose for your mouth. It's to activate the love of God and the blessings of God that the love provides. That's why Satan doesn't mind. If you sit here and hear a sermon for one hour, two hours, and you never say amen. You're not. You're still sophisticated to say anything. And Satan doesn't mind because a silent Christian is a weak Christian. It's silent church is a weak church. Not because power is unavailable. The love of God is present in your life. The love of God is for you. Are you hear me? No weapon form against you can prosper. The enemy cannot overcome you church. All the power we need for everything that God wants to do in our lives consists of his will is already provided and it's flowing here with unlimited. But if we come Sunday after Sunday and we just sit we never open our mouths. We don't agree with the truth. We don't say amen. We don't say yes. We don't agree with just. You have been exposed to power but you have not partaking of it. The water was flowing but you never brought yourself in alignment with that. And so you came thru say and you went thru say you came dry you went dry you came weak you went weak because you never opened your mouth. You're drained. Are you hear me? Are you hearing me church? Yeah that's why I said she illustrated my point. Men are you are here. We say say amen. Say hallelujah. The worship is going. You can't even open your mouth to sing the praises. There's nothing that happens that you can say thank you Jesus hallelujah. I receive that yes that's true. Say to Lord that because He knows as long as you're silent you're not making the connection. As long as you're silent you're not receiving the power. You're not receiving the love. Are you hearing me? Say to understand the authority of your voice. Don't just believe speak. Speak to your mouth. Speak to your problem. Jesus says say to the mountain. Say it. Say it. Say it. Tell your mountain what to do. Tell your obstacle what to do. You're based upon the revelation of God's love being available being all powerful by which nothing nothing nothing can succeed against you. Go ahead and speak it. Speak into your problem. Speak into your body. Speak into your finances. Speak into your soul. Speak into your mind. Speak into your brother. Speak into your system. Then it's time you align yourself with the love of God and your love the power of that love to flow into your life. Are you hearing me? Jesus said I can't see my time. I got no idea. Now she tells me zero. Are you hearing Jesus said if two of us agree concerning anything it should be done. It's two agree that word agree means subsidizing. It means harmonizing. It's a vocal agreement. Not just a mental one. I hear me. So if two of us vocal agree having response in a greater way. Now imagine if a hundred of us vocal agrees. Imagine that principle. Then multiply that by entire church that shows up on Sunday to vocal agree with the word of God. What a great God has been preached to vocal agree with the greatness of God with worshiping and we're praising. Can you imagine all of us with our mouths aligned so that I'm getting full of God's love you're getting full of God's love all of us are getting full of God's love and all of that love is being manifested here. That is what terrifies the devil. Not our coming and being silent but our vocalizing our agreement with the word with who God is. God's purposes. That's why when we go to the 21 days of prayer fasting. It's not enough for you just a mental agree that we should be fasting. It's not enough for you to just a mental agree or we should be praying. That's a good thing. One thousand of us can mental agree and nothing happens. Not because God was withholding power. Because love has already provided all the power there is. But it's because God's people have been neutralized by their silence. And we're being able to justify our absence and your absence you saw has been neutralized our silence power silence the power the greatest power available that can be manifested. That is available to the church as a spiritual weapon is when we actually come together individually we agree with God but then we come together and all of us vocalize our agreement to the word to God's greatness, God's plan, God's purpose, God's power. We vocalize we agree in terms of our requests say to understand the authority. Be here me when we're doing that we're not just making noise. You're creating a legal environment. Are you hear me when we're all vocalizing our agreement we are creating a legal environment that allows heaven to work powerfully and that forces the enemy to flee the enemy is terrified. Let's keep him afraid let's keep him terrified throughout this year in the name of Jesus say hallelujah. You got to come back next week to finish a message. So I saw. But did you hear what I just said the love of God is what the most powerful force at work and that love is already flowing in abundance and there's nothing no problem no difficult no challenge you ever going to face this year that the love of God is not strong event and that's already made provision for you can rest in that reality.

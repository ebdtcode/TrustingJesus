want to give the figure, I'm not going to give the figure, but I think it's okay to say it's tens of thousands more than her last job. Her last job was good. So this is a huge increase. So indeed Sunday has come in Jesus' name. Amen. Hallelujah. Again, that's God's love at work in Anita's light. Amen. So we rejoice because the love of God can deliver. We said that God's love is almighty and there's absolutely nothing that the love of God cannot do for you and for me in our circumstances. Raise your hand and take about 10 seconds and let's just express our gratitude for his unfailing love in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. Say thank God for his unfailing love. So the question is never whether God loves me or there's anything his love will not or cannot do for me. Here's the question. The question is am I agreeing with this? Am I expressing my agreement with my words and with my works? That agreement piece is important. Let me repeat. The question is not whether God loves you and whether his love is able. That is such a fact. The question that I must ask myself and you must ask yourself in every situation is am I agreeing with this revelation that God loves me, his love is able to do everything and anything that needs to be done. I hear me. Am I agreeing with that? And am I in my speech? Your speech is important. Your words are important. Expressing that agreement. You see there's a common misconception and a misconception is well if God is there and God loves me then I don't need to do anything to experience the benefits. Not God would love you no matter what you do or don't do. That love is constant. But your experience is affected by choices you make. Are you hear me? God's love opens the door but you have a choice to walk in and walk through or not. God's love makes the offer but you have a choice to take it or not take it. I hear me. So that's important. God has established certain laws that we have to respect. His love does not cancel those laws because those laws are good laws anyway. And when I'm talking about laws, I'm not talking about the commandments trying to get salvation. I'm just talking about the way things operate. But is this in the natural? The way things operate if you want to harvest your plant seeds. Right? That's the way God operates. He gives you. He can give you the ground. The soil can be great. He gives you sunshine, gives you rain. But the law says you still have to plant a seed and the seed you plant will determine the harvest. You cannot put an apple seed and get orange trees. You follow me? That's a law that God's love doesn't cancel but God's love enables you and me to take advantage of it. Those laws so that we maximize or experience the maximum benefits. God has given you the power of choice. That's in the free will. That's something that God loves that's not canceled. You still have the power of choice. You still have a free will. In the book of tyrannomy that I said before your life and death. Now you choose. People are going to hell today because of their choices. We're going to heaven because we chose Jesus. But salvation is available to everybody. Anybody who goes to hell goes to hell because you didn't choose Jesus. Everybody who goes to heaven goes to heaven because he chose Jesus. But love makes that available to everybody. You hear me? So it is important as we celebrate and grow in the revelation of God's love that we understand how that love operates and what our response should be in order for us to experience that which is already legally and spiritually hours. Say amen. So you can be deeply loved by God like all of us are and we can still live a light heavily influenced, heavily dominated by the enemy. Simply by aligning our speech with the enemy's narrative. By aligning my speech with his lies, repeating his lies, speaking his lies, allowing my feelings and my emotions to detect and determine what I say even though God loves me, if I align my speech with the enemy's lies, what I will experience will be the enemy's lies. You follow me? So it's important that we know what God has said, know what God has accomplished through Jesus Christ, the finished work of Christ, know the promises that love makes. And then align ourselves in particular, I'm going to focus on words, but align our words and our works with God's words and God's character so that we can experience the manifestation of that which is already spiritually, legally hours. I want to show you a number of verses that just reinforce this point. All right? So keep this in mind. I have a responsibility to make choices. I am still a free moral agent. God's love does not replace or remove that. I have choices to make. All right? So the woman with the issue of blood is an example. She had this condition for how many years was it 12 years? As she went from doctor to doctor, did everything she knew to do in a natural to get healed and she didn't get healed. But she heard about Jesus. And the Bible says faith comes by hearing. So she heard the stories of Jesus and that put faith in her heart. And then she heard Jesus was coming by. Jesus was in her neighbor who Jesus was going to be passing by and she positioned herself to receive her healing, to participate in that healing which had been provided for her in Christ, which was available. She now knowing that she had access to it, determined that she was going to partake of it. And how did she partake of it? She said and the Bible says she kept saying if I can just touch the hymn of his garment, I will be healed. She began to speak. So now the love of God and the healing power God that was present in Christ, she decided that she was going to appropriate it. And the thing she did was to open her mouth and with a worse begin to align herself with who Jesus was, what Jesus could do. I hear me she began to speak the healing out of her mouth. So her words and then her works because she started to move towards Jesus and reach out to him. And her words and her works came together in alignment with who Jesus was. And what happened? She got healed. And then Jesus feeling virtue come out of him, turned to her and said woman, your faith. What a minute. Was it her faith or Jesus? Both. Because it was Jesus's power but it was her choice to exercise faith in Jesus's power that caused her to receive that which was spiritually and legally available to her to receive it so that she would have a physical manifestation or physical experience. So both God's love and her faith work together to produce that miracle. Turn to your neighbor and say you have you have you possess the love of God and you also have faith. Amen. God because of his love provides you with faith. So it's not like you have none. You have faith. The Bible says he has dealt also all of us want the measure of faith. So we have faith. We just need to make the choice to use it. We have it and we can use it. Or we cannot use it as a choice. But you have the love of God and you have faith come and raise your head and thank God again for his goodness and his love. Hallelujah. So that if we're going to benefit fully from the love of God that's available to us in Christ Jesus because of his finished work, his death on the cross is life in us. One of the things we have to learn is how to use faith. But to really learn how to use the faith we have, we have to have a good biblical understanding of the power of words. How words impact our lives in general and how words impact our faith in particular. Say to the person next to you you need to know the power of words. How words impact your life in general and your faith in particular. Hallelujah. Another example is a Roman centurion. You heard about him. He came to Jesus because his servant was sick, very, very sick under death. Again, hopeless situation. He came to Jesus and master. You know, I think he sent some people to Jesus and I'm gonna say it because he didn't feel worthy. But he asked, he was asking for the Lord to go and heal his servant. And the Lord being who he is always wanting to heal this love, he instantly said, our come. He didn't know this man. This man had no covenant relationship with him. He was a gentile at that time. The covenant at work was with the Jewish people. But Jesus loves people and he didn't allow the Lord to keep him from ministering life and love. So he said, I'm gonna come. Jesus was repaired. I don't know how long the distance was, but he was repaired and leave where he was to go to that man's house and heal him. But the man said to Jesus, a centurion said, Lord, you don't have to come. All you have to do is what? Just speak the word of my servant will be healed. Jesus looked at this man and he marveled. He said, wow. Jesus marveled because everybody of Jesus was dealing with their faith would have required him to go to the house. But this man said something that Jesus had never heard any of the Jewish folks say. He said, you don't have to come. I know, I know how authority works. I know what authority can do. I know that with authority you can command power. And a man in authority doesn't have to do anything but speak in order to release power to cause action and results. I'm a man, I thought I know how it works. You just need to speak and your words will command power enough to heal my son. Wow. That's the revelation you need and that's the revelation I need. And if we can grow in this revelation and become as certain as this Roman centurion was that all he needed was the word to get the results. My brother and sister, the level of miracles and the kind of answers to pray you and I will begin to experience will go to another level. Say Lord, open my eyes that I may walk in the revelation that this centurion had that all you need to do is to speak. We all know that the way you people in authority released power to cause things to be done is simply speaking. And man, you know, whatever happened in Venezuela, whether you like it or not, this is not a, I'm making a point so don't get into politics here. The point is President Donald Trump didn't go to Venezuela. He's in a position of great authority as President of the United States. And all he had to do to cause whatever happened, all the power of the U.S. army to be dispatched to accomplish what he wanted because of his authority, he just needed to speak. Just words provoked power that produced those results. That's how you exercise power. If you're in authority, all you need to do is to speak. You hear me? Words, carry authority and worse command power. Say my words, carry authority and command. All right, so let's quickly look at some scriptures as I amplified this truth. Genesis chapter 1 verse 3, God begins to create the world. And how does he create it? The Bible says, and God said, let there be light. And there was life. For the second time, you can go through Genesis chapter 1 and every day God created new things and all he did was to speak. Let there be and it was. And God said, and it was. Come on, say, and God said, and it was. And God said, and it was all went over again. And the scriptures could have just said worse and God said and then tell you all the things that God said, but there's a repetition and God said and God said and God said and I believe the repetition is for emphasis. The repetition is for revelation. God wants us to understand the power of words and how with words we can command light or darkness with words. That's how God created everything with his words. And then in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and chapter 11, the scripture says that he created all things by the words, all things were framed. I hear me? Everything that was created, everything, every star, every planet, everything. And this universe is huge. Everything was created just by speech. With his words, he commanded the authority and the power that produced everything. Didn't have to get off his throne. Didn't have to move. All he had to do was speak and then with words commanded power. Not only did he create the promises, even now, everything is being held together by that same word. It is the word of God that is manifested in the power that is holding the planets in their position. It is the word of God that is exercising the power that is keeping you in your seat. You call it gravity. But gravity is the word of God manifest in power that keeps you grounded. And by the way, it can keep you grounded spiritually, too. Keep you grounded emotionally. Amen? Say thank God for your word. So God by His word created everything. Hallelujah. One of the truths that we need to be wrong from this is that God does not use His word to describe reality. God uses His word to create reality. I hear me. And that's important because too many of us use our words to describe what we see, reality, rather than using our words to create reality. If you want what you see to continue to be what you see, keep describing it. No. If you want the condition you're dealing with to continue, keep using your mouth and your words only to describe the conditions as they are. There was the earth was without form. It was void. Darkness come to the earth. If God had looked at it, it's always so dark. Darkness is covering the earth. There is chaos everywhere. You know what was going to happen? It was going to get darker. The chaos was going to get greater. And many of us not understanding the power of words, use our words to empower and give life, the situations that we want to bring to an end. If you and I want to change our circumstances in any way or change our lives in any way, we've got to understand that words should not be used nearly to describe reality. In fact, as much as possible, use your words to create reality. Jesus, in Mark, let me say, if you say to this mountain, be loud, remove, be that cast in the sea. Don't doubt in your heart. But you can, but you say it. He says you'll have whatever you say. Those are spiritual truths. Those are realities. Those are spiritual laws and the love of God does not cancel the power of your speech. What we ought to do is understand the power of words and then use our words to tap into the love of God so that we can experience all of those wonderful benefits Christ has given us. All right. Say after me, say words are not just sounds. They release authority. They command power in Jesus' name. Hallelujah. Now, after creating his word, God created man. And before creating man, God said, let us create man in our image. And then God said, let him have dominion over the earth. Let him rule the earth. Let him govern the earth. Did God say that? So God created man and said, I want man to govern the earth and all other created things. Everything you see on earth, every created thing, your dogs, my puppies, sonny and rosy and all of those animals, the lions and the bears and all of that, God said, I want man to have dominion over them. Now, God created every living thing. And you know what? My dogs can have a sense of smell that is much stronger than mine. They smell things that I don't smell. They have a sense of hearing. It's amazing. They can hear stuff that I don't hear. So in many ways, there's senses they have that they are greater than ours. But there's one thing sonny and rosy cannot do. They cannot talk. God reserved the power of speech for man. He gave all of these animals abilities greater than ours in so many areas. But one thing he didn't give them is the ability to speak because the ability to speak is for the governor. Because he says, now I want them to have dominion so I am going to give them the ability to speak because it is through the speaking the use of words that they will exercise the authority that will command power to be able to govern the earth. It's not by accident that all of these animals don't talk because they were not created to rule. They were not created to govern. And so God said, I'm not going to give you the ability to speak because I give you the ability to speak. I'm giving you authority to command power. The first thing God did then after creating Adam in his image and giving him dominion God's, the Bible says God brought all the animals to Adam so that Adam can name them and so I don't know what the language Adam spoke but let's assume Adam spoke English. If Adam was speaking English he looked at the lion he said lion. He looked at the bear he said bear. He looked at the hippopotamus he said and you know every animal he named and the Bible says every name that Adam gave to those animals that was the name. Now God was there. But the scriptures are very clear God brought the animals to Adam. Why didn't God name the animals himself? I have sure God could have come up with much better names that Adam came up with because some of the names Adam calls these animals I don't if he was speaking English even I could have done better but the Bible says every decision Adam made and whatever Adam said you bear you hippopotamus you fish you eagle that was established and God did not interfere. Now once the God said no I don't like that name. Once Adam spoke God accepted it. It became so why God had given Adam to be an Adam. God had given Adam authority and God had given Adam speech so he got exercise at authority so once Adam spoke he was governing. Once Adam spoke he was exercise in dominion. Once Adam spoke he was exercises his authority commanding the power to be so. God did not interfere because God respected the authority that Adam had to govern the earth. Why did God respect it because God gave it to him? Are you hear me? God did not interfere God did not change. So at that point Adam begins to call these animals by name and everything he says becomes so which means Adam is not governing the earth with his words. He is establishing order. He is determining how things operate here and what he is saying God is respecting. So I know sometimes we say well if God has allowed us and God is permitting this and the truth is God is not the one running earth now. The day will come when our lease will end but for now God is respecting what we say. Now that green what you say but respecting your authority and your right to say and exercise your authority. So when you choose to speak words of death rather than words of life in a song and you can't blame God you could speak words of life. I said before years blessing here's death choose life and the way you choose life is with your words right now you should be using your words to establish some truth to him. I told you last week silence there were lots of you to be silent because you're not exercising an authority when you silent. You're not commanding anything when you're silent. I hear me you're not changing anything you're not using your authority you're not establishing anything. You're not creating reality when you're silent. You just letting things be as they are. And if you like them like they are then maybe you should keep your mouth shut because sometimes we small things will open our mouth. If you remember the story of Zacharias and John the Baptist's father the angel appeared to him and told him all that God was going to do then he began to open his mouth to speak. God the angel said I'm going to shut your mouth right now because if I allow you to continue to speak everything I just told you would be put a hold. So until this child is born you're not going to say another word. He wasn't punishing him he was shutting his mouth out so that God's purpose could be fulfilled. Are you listening to me? So God exercises authority he creates reality. He doesn't just use words to describe what is. He uses words to create reality. He exercises authority. He can pass power with his words. He created Adam in his image gave Adam dominion here and therefore gave Adam and no other animal the ability to speak because Adam would exercise dominion and govern on earth with his words and that's exactly how you and I are created to function. Amen. The areas over which you have authority the way you exercise authority and create realities across God's will to be done in this areas is with your words. Notice I said the areas over which you have authority. The things that you have authority over and the things that you don't you don't have authority over me. I don't have authority over you. I cannot command things to happen in your home and in your family. I can command things to happen in my home. If I command things to happen in your life you have to be an agreement for them to happen. If you disagree I got to authority. Now you have authority over sin you have authority over sickness you have authority over demon so you can command them anytime. Amen and when you command them know that hey by words in the name of Jesus have commanded authority and the power necessary to do this is is released. So over those things that you and I have been given to men and over and authority over we have those are men and authority over other people that we can come in agreement. That's what God said we come in agreement and I say and you say and together we say the same thing together we're exercising authority and God can actually do more it seems when more people are in agreement but what you need to understand is this agreement is with your words. Faith is released with words you cannot separate the operation of faith from words they're tied together all right so God creates he creates Adam and then the Bible says after he creates Adam he breathes into Adam and that's important because you know the Bible doesn't say those he breathes into any other animal but he breathes into Adam and that breath that God puts into Adam is what gives him the disability to speak and to speak like God you have it you got it you capture that so the way God exercises his authority to govern is what words the way Adam exercises authority to govern is with words the way men today in positions of authority exercise that authority to govern whatever they're governing on the natural level is with words I used Donald Trump president as an example and the way you govern the way you govern the way you govern your own life and the way you govern your own affairs and the way you govern what happens to you is with your words and so if you and I are going to truly benefit from the love of God and all that that love provides we've got to understand how important our words are and make a quality choice and decision that in 2026 and beyond we're going to speak words that align with God's love and God's purpose for us in Jesus name quickly let's go to another scripture because we have a lot to cover and I don't know we have to tie first Peter 310 if I go to first go to first Peter 3.9 and then we'll do 9 and 10 amen but first Peter 3.9 let's read it to Paul Peter speaking to Christians that he telling them how to behave and how to conduct themselves but he reveals something here about words that I want us to look at let's read it together not returning evil for evil or reviling for in other words it's somebody curse you don't curse them back if someone talk means or you don't talk mean back to them because someone treats you wrong don't treat them wrong that's what he's saying can we agree now you have a choice right you can do it and not do it but their consequences okay knowing together let's say that knowing that you are called to this that you may what is God's plan and purpose for you that you may do what inherit a blessing what does God want for you to inherit a blessing all of us for tip possession of the blessings that you have inherited hallelujah so he says don't revive don't curse someone because they curse you go back please to the other words but instead you should do what bless in other words you should speak words of blessing when he says but on the contrary blessing he means instead of opening your mouth to cuss the person who just made you angry open your mouth to say mean things to give them a piece of your mind somebody say we have given so many pieces of our mind and way we don't have all of God but God is saying do do that you got authority your words release authority and power you need to be conscious of that words are not neutral they cost things to happen so he says instead of cussing speak words of blessing why because God wants you to take possession of the blessing so the words that come under your mouth will impact whether or not you actually take possession of the blessings many of us have unclaimed or un-possessed blessings they're there they have our name on it but we haven't been able to pick up the parcel and Peter is saying one of the reasons you don't have possession or you haven't inherit or you haven't taken all of it it's because you don't know how to talk you just let anything come out of your mouth you let your feelings to tremor what you say you let your emotions control your speech and because you allow your emotions to control your speech you're not enjoying the blessing of God's love that blessing is one of the blessings of his love that's your inheritance because he loves you but you're not taking possession of it because you're not controlling your speech go to the next verse for let's read this together everybody he who would love life and see how many you want you you want yeah you love life and you want to see good days no you see some of you not even agree raise your hand and say I love life mind you if you're silent and just listening and you're not speaking you're not possessing and now I want to keep emphasizing this if all you do is listen and hear and get information but you don't open your mouth and begin to speak to exercise the authority to command the power that will bring the results you will not possess all you shall have whatsoever you say Jesus said when God created the world the power didn't say and God thought and God hoped it said and God said so I'm preaching it all you do okay I'm hoping and you just you you you're hoping it's that's not that's why I let it alone I wish you received the blessing so let's read this now for he who would love life and see good days and that's all of us let him refrain his tongue from what evil and his lips from speaking to see lies falsehood the other translation says he must refrain he must refrain if you want to experience all of the blessings of your inheritance the love of God has provided this scripture is telling you very clearly you cannot overlook the power of your speech you cannot be careless with your words you can't be talking and cussing people and saying things to people and expect to be able to walk in the inheritance you cannot be speaking evil with your lips now what is evil evil is any word that comes out of your mouth that contradicts or is not in alignment with what God has said or what God has done in Christ and at the time I open my mouth to say something that is not in alignment with scripture contradicts what God has said I'm speaking evil and at the time I open my mouth to speak things that are not in alignment with what Christ has accomplished for us by his death and by his resurrection is evil and that will prevent us from being able to take possession of what God has given freely secondly anything you speak that is contrary to God's nature God is love so wherever I open my mouth to speak things that contradict God's love nature to speak unkind things I am speaking evil and by so doing I am not refraining my tongue I'm using my lips in a way that is actually going to block and hinder and prevent or delay the blessing God has already prepared with my name on it you you understand so again when you cussing or you say things mean to one another you're actually hindering your blessings that's why even when it comes to husband and wife God says to a piece fully with them so your prayers cannot be hindered again he's talking about your words because when my wife and I are fussing we're using words I always say good things to her amen amen but you but that's reality let's laugh and have fun but this is life and death matters so do what guard your lips the Baba says life and death are where in the power of the tongue that's Proverbs 1821 says life and death in the power that the so with your tongue you can attract life or you can attract death why does the words have that kind of power because words think of words also as containers all right and our words carry faith hope and love our words can also carry fear hopelessness and hatred I can release faith with my words hope with my words love with my words and when I do that those are the things that the Holy Spirit works with and so when my words are releasing faith and hope and love my words are creating the environment in which the Holy Spirit who is the spirit of life works so my words then so have the power of life but if I release with my words instead of love hatred instead of faith fear instead of hope despair those words create the environment that allow when I speak faith and I speak hope and I speak love God shows up to manifest Himself in my situation I'm introducing God's love into my circumstances but when I speak fear and I speak hatred and I speak despair guess who comes knocking demons come knocking at the door but this is true and so with our words we're creating the conditions that can allow the spirit of life to work all the spirit of death to work in our circumstances go to James chapter 1 verse 26 please we've got to land this plane but let's look at this let's read it together if anyone among you thinks he is religious and does not want bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart this once religion is useless one for just a worthless you know what that verse is said means you can come to church every Sunday you can pay your tithe or I don't like paying you can give your tithe worship with your tithe and with your offerings every Sunday you can do a lot of good religious things you can visit the poor you can do all of those things and those things are good he says but if you don't bridle your tongue if you don't accept controls on your tongue if you do not allow your tongue to speak under that which is consistent with who God is his word and his finish works if you just talk and let your feelings control your speech he says everything else that you're doing doesn't matter you it's worthless if you're destroying everything you're building so you can you know we're fasting right now and praying and God is hearing prayer but no matter how much we fast and how much we pray if we don't bridle our tongue if we continue to speak nothing but unbelief hatred helplessness if we just keep describing what is our prayer fasting would be useless are you listening so what are you going to do you have to make some decisions let's go to one more and then we're done go to James chapter three I believe it begins as verse two I hope I'm right James chapter three yes okay James again is speaking about speech let's read together please so we all stumble in many things if anyone does not stumble in word he is a perfect man a mature man able to bride of the whole body some of the problems you're having with the lust of the flesh the reason why you continue to act the way you act and you keep committing the same sins over over it's with it's with your mouth it's what you're saying that is causing your body to be able to do what it does so he says if you want to control your body start with your mouth if you want to control your behavior the power deduces in your mouth instead of saying I'm a sinner so I say I'm righteous so I say I'm loved by God start saying I'm holy in God's sight start saying I am the temple of the living God I hear me start agreeing with God's word concerning who he is what is that who you are start with your words coming into alignment with God's word and God's the finished word and you'll find that your body will start to conform it may not happen overnight but if you keep speaking that word and keep speaking that word you are releasing the authority you are exercising your authority you're commanding things to happen and because you have authority to govern your life in the corners of God's word things will begin to come into alignment and they will come when you when you try to do that thing you will find I can't get no more joy no more pleasure out of that it's gone and man you guys are not saying amen anymore he's able to bridle the whole body that's going quickly we are running out of time quickly quickly let's go three okay he's taken to wild so here's a point this chapter is going to say that the tongue is like a rudder that can turn the rudder does what it turns the ship have you seen how big a ship is a rudder how big is a rudder I haven't seen one but it's small but the captain can turn that thing around it can be going north and he can make it turn completely to go south and all he has to do is turn the rudder and the rudder will turn the ship if you're driving your car if you want to go east what do you do you turn east you determine where you want to go and then you stare in that direction and that causes the car to go where you wanted to go this is what he's saying he's saying your tongue the words that you say was set the direction of your life and if your life is headed in the direction that you don't want it to go you have authority in your mouth with your words so determine the change that you want to happen and with your words you can literally tap into the power of God that would turn your vessel completely now that ship doesn't turn if it's going south it takes a while for it to make a you turn by the minute the rudder is turning begins to move and so some things will happen quickly in your life and some things may take a while but don't turn the rudder away from where you want to keep the rudder where you want it to go keep your mouth where you want to go don't let the feelings in the circumstances cause you say aye it's not working no this is where I want to go I want to live a whole life I want to live a righteous life I want to live a victorious life I want to fulfill God's purpose I want to do God's will I want to fulfill my destiny I want to experience the promises of God I want my life to glorify God and that's where you want the change will begin in your mouth so open your mouth and begin to speak what the word of God says and every time you do that you are exercising spiritual authority that is commanding spiritual power in order to bring about the results that God has promised you and that the love of God makes available to you in Christ Jesus do you receive it say hallelujah are you do us of the word or hear us only you are do us of the word and man you need to say that you see if you want to be a do of the word say I'm a doer of the word men of you are struggling and you seem never to be able to overcome and it's because you keep describing what you have you keep describing you you're not saying what God says and man this verse or this passage tells you you know if you if you say I don't know how I will make it through this difficult time no job what you've done you scared the ship towards the rocks but if you say my God supplies all my needs according to his riches and glory I don't care what's happening on the outside the Lord is my shepherd I should not want are you hear me if you said Jesus it's a supply of this need I got Jesus I already got if he said the word of God has been spoken he cannot return for it you have shared that ship into an open seed of provision and the doctor said you're sick and we you know we can't help you and and every time everybody you meet you say oh the doctor said I'm sick and he can't help me you've got no reason to say you just saying it I mean I mean if you if you are dealing with illness and you need to say it to a doctor because the doctor needs to know so he that's one thing but everywhere you go you just oh I'm sickle the doctor said oh you know they're treating me oh oh but the problem if that's all you're talking you are simply reinforcing that reality that you don't want to change I'm not saying I'm not saying deny what is but only talk about what is only because it's necessary but spend your time speaking about the reality that you are believing and creating that you know the love of God has already made provision for and let your mouth continually declare God's word so instead of saying everything the doctor say you know I but about the stripes of Jesus I'm healed but I'm going to live and not die but are you hear me you're supposed to do all of that and I die then go to heaven amen but what if you do all of that and you let because you do what if you keep talking about your problem and you die because you keep talking about your problem make a choice which is better speak life amen and we have a powerful example of that evangelist Billy Gray I'm Billy Gray if I just a Billy Bimba that man should be dead you know how many times cancer I mean attacks him and I mean the only reason Billy Bimba is alive is because he refused to stop saying I will live and not die I mean he said that when the pain he said that when the condition was getting worse he said that when the medicine wasn't working man I take my ass off to him because to go through that and not paint but his words literally turn that ship around amen and now the man who should be dead is all over the world the devil should have left him alone because Billy is more on fire now than ever before listen I don't care what you're what you're facing choose life and the way you choose life is to choose words of life choose life you choose life when you choose to say what God says you choose in life when you choose to speak in alignment with God's word and act in alignment with God's character you choose in life I hear me and when you choose life you allow love the love of God to fulfill its many promises in your situation don't make it hard for God to bless you amen don't make it hard for the blessings of God to come to you and locate you and find you in 2026 say hallelujah everybody stand to their feet hallelujah raise your hand and say father I choose life I choose to believe your love for me will do for me and have done for me everything I will ever need for life and Godliness father I choose to believe that goodness and mercy will follow me every day of my life I choose to believe that angels I come about me and they will deliver me a thousand may follow my ten thousand my right hand I choose to believe it will not come not me all that with my eyes will I behold and see the reward of the wicked I choose to believe what long live you will satisfy me and show me your salvation I choose to believe I'm righteous I'm holy I'm blameless and Jesus name amen now the most important words you can say is Jesus I confess you as my lord and that's my savior it is those words spoken from my believing heart that changes their eternal destiny so everyone here whether you have received Christ or not if you desire Christ to be your savior Lord raise your hands again as a Jesus Christ today I believe in my heart and I confess with my mouth that you are my lord and my savior thank you


## Detailed Transcript with Timestamps

**[Unknown - 00:03]** want to give the figure, I'm not going to give the figure, but I think it's okay to say it's

**[00:03 - 00:11]** tens of thousands more than her last job. Her last job was good. So this is a huge increase.

**[00:13 - 00:20]** So indeed Sunday has come in Jesus' name. Amen. Hallelujah. Again, that's God's love at work

**[00:20 - 00:29]** in Anita's light. Amen. So we rejoice because the love of God can deliver. We said that God's

**[00:29 - 00:37]** love is almighty and there's absolutely nothing that the love of God cannot do for you and for me

**[00:38 - 00:44]** in our circumstances. Raise your hand and take about 10 seconds and let's just express

**[00:45 - 00:53]** our gratitude for his unfailing love in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. Say thank God

**[00:54 - 01:01]** for his unfailing love. So the question is never whether God loves me or there's anything

**[01:02 - 01:09]** his love will not or cannot do for me. Here's the question. The question is am I agreeing with

**[01:09 - 01:18]** this? Am I expressing my agreement with my words and with my works? That agreement piece is

**[01:18 - 01:27]** important. Let me repeat. The question is not whether God loves you and whether his love is

**[01:27 - 01:33]** able. That is such a fact. The question that I must ask myself and you must ask yourself in every

**[01:33 - 01:44]** situation is am I agreeing with this revelation that God loves me, his love is able to do everything

**[01:44 - 01:51]** and anything that needs to be done. I hear me. Am I agreeing with that? And am I in my speech?

**[01:52 - 02:00]** Your speech is important. Your words are important. Expressing that agreement. You see there's

**[02:00 - 02:06]** a common misconception and a misconception is well if God is there and God loves me then I don't

**[02:06 - 02:11]** need to do anything to experience the benefits. Not God would love you no matter what you do or don't

**[02:11 - 02:18]** do. That love is constant. But your experience is affected by choices you make.

**[02:19 - 02:25]** Are you hear me? God's love opens the door but you have a choice to walk in and walk through

**[02:25 - 02:31]** or not. God's love makes the offer but you have a choice to take it or not take it.

**[02:31 - 02:43]** I hear me. So that's important. God has established certain laws that we have to respect. His love does

**[02:43 - 02:48]** not cancel those laws because those laws are good laws anyway. And when I'm talking about laws,

**[02:48 - 02:52]** I'm not talking about the commandments trying to get salvation. I'm just talking about the way things

**[02:52 - 02:57]** operate. But is this in the natural? The way things operate if you want to harvest your plant seeds.

**[02:58 - 03:05]** Right? That's the way God operates. He gives you. He can give you the ground. The soil can be

**[03:05 - 03:10]** great. He gives you sunshine, gives you rain. But the law says you still have to plant a seed and

**[03:10 - 03:15]** the seed you plant will determine the harvest. You cannot put an apple seed and get orange trees.

**[03:16 - 03:21]** You follow me? That's a law that God's love doesn't cancel but God's love enables you and

**[03:21 - 03:28]** me to take advantage of it. Those laws so that we maximize or experience the maximum benefits.

**[03:28 - 03:33]** God has given you the power of choice. That's in the free will. That's something that God

**[03:33 - 03:39]** loves that's not canceled. You still have the power of choice. You still have a free will.

**[03:39 - 03:44]** In the book of tyrannomy that I said before your life and death. Now you choose. People are going

**[03:44 - 03:49]** to hell today because of their choices. We're going to heaven because we chose Jesus.

**[03:49 - 03:56]** But salvation is available to everybody. Anybody who goes to hell goes to hell because you didn't

**[03:56 - 04:01]** choose Jesus. Everybody who goes to heaven goes to heaven because he chose Jesus. But love makes

**[04:01 - 04:08]** that available to everybody. You hear me? So it is important as we celebrate and grow in the

**[04:08 - 04:18]** revelation of God's love that we understand how that love operates and what our response

**[04:18 - 04:24]** should be in order for us to experience that which is already legally and spiritually

**[04:25 - 04:33]** hours. Say amen. So you can be deeply loved by God like all of us are and we can still live a

**[04:33 - 04:41]** light heavily influenced, heavily dominated by the enemy. Simply by aligning our speech with the

**[04:41 - 04:48]** enemy's narrative. By aligning my speech with his lies, repeating his lies, speaking his lies,

**[04:50 - 04:57]** allowing my feelings and my emotions to detect and determine what I say even though God loves me,

**[04:58 - 05:06]** if I align my speech with the enemy's lies, what I will experience will be the enemy's lies.

**[05:09 - 05:16]** You follow me? So it's important that we know what God has said, know what God has accomplished

**[05:16 - 05:21]** through Jesus Christ, the finished work of Christ, know the promises that love makes.

**[05:22 - 05:29]** And then align ourselves in particular, I'm going to focus on words, but align our words and our works

**[05:30 - 05:36]** with God's words and God's character so that we can experience the manifestation of that which

**[05:36 - 05:42]** is already spiritually, legally hours. I want to show you a number of verses that just reinforce

**[05:42 - 05:51]** this point. All right? So keep this in mind. I have a responsibility to make choices. I am still a

**[05:51 - 06:00]** free moral agent. God's love does not replace or remove that. I have choices to make. All right?

**[06:01 - 06:06]** So the woman with the issue of blood is an example. She had this condition for how many years

**[06:06 - 06:12]** was it 12 years? As she went from doctor to doctor, did everything she knew to do in a natural

**[06:12 - 06:17]** to get healed and she didn't get healed. But she heard about Jesus. And the Bible says faith

**[06:17 - 06:21]** comes by hearing. So she heard the stories of Jesus and that put faith in her heart.

**[06:21 - 06:26]** And then she heard Jesus was coming by. Jesus was in her neighbor who Jesus was going to be passing by

**[06:26 - 06:35]** and she positioned herself to receive her healing, to participate in that healing which had been

**[06:35 - 06:41]** provided for her in Christ, which was available. She now knowing that she had access to it,

**[06:41 - 06:45]** determined that she was going to partake of it. And how did she partake of it? She said

**[06:45 - 06:53]** and the Bible says she kept saying if I can just touch the hymn of his garment, I will be healed. She

**[06:53 - 07:00]** began to speak. So now the love of God and the healing power God that was present in Christ,

**[07:01 - 07:07]** she decided that she was going to appropriate it. And the thing she did was to open her mouth

**[07:08 - 07:15]** and with a worse begin to align herself with who Jesus was, what Jesus could do. I hear me

**[07:15 - 07:21]** she began to speak the healing out of her mouth. So her words and then her works because she started to

**[07:21 - 07:27]** move towards Jesus and reach out to him. And her words and her works came together in alignment with

**[07:27 - 07:34]** who Jesus was. And what happened? She got healed. And then Jesus feeling virtue come out of him,

**[07:34 - 07:41]** turned to her and said woman, your faith. What a minute. Was it her faith or Jesus?

**[07:42 - 07:51]** Both. Because it was Jesus's power but it was her choice to exercise faith in Jesus's power

**[07:51 - 07:57]** that caused her to receive that which was spiritually and legally available to her to receive it so

**[07:57 - 08:04]** that she would have a physical manifestation or physical experience. So both God's love and her

**[08:04 - 08:11]** faith work together to produce that miracle. Turn to your neighbor and say you have you have

**[08:11 - 08:19]** you possess the love of God and you also have faith. Amen. God because of his love provides you with

**[08:19 - 08:24]** faith. So it's not like you have none. You have faith. The Bible says he has dealt also all of us

**[08:24 - 08:33]** want the measure of faith. So we have faith. We just need to make the choice to use it. We have it

**[08:33 - 08:39]** and we can use it. Or we cannot use it as a choice. But you have the love of God and you have

**[08:39 - 08:44]** faith come and raise your head and thank God again for his goodness and his love. Hallelujah.

**[08:44 - 08:51]** So that if we're going to benefit fully from the love of God that's available to us in Christ

**[08:51 - 08:58]** Jesus because of his finished work, his death on the cross is life in us. One of the things we

**[08:58 - 09:04]** have to learn is how to use faith. But to really learn how to use the faith we have, we have to have

**[09:04 - 09:12]** a good biblical understanding of the power of words. How words impact our lives in general and how

**[09:12 - 09:20]** words impact our faith in particular. Say to the person next to you you need to know the power

**[09:20 - 09:34]** of words. How words impact your life in general and your faith in particular. Hallelujah.

**[09:35 - 09:41]** Another example is a Roman centurion. You heard about him. He came to Jesus because his servant was

**[09:41 - 09:47]** sick, very, very sick under death. Again, hopeless situation. He came to Jesus and master. You know,

**[09:47 - 09:52]** I think he sent some people to Jesus and I'm gonna say it because he didn't feel worthy. But he

**[09:52 - 09:58]** asked, he was asking for the Lord to go and heal his servant. And the Lord being who he is always

**[09:58 - 10:03]** wanting to heal this love, he instantly said, our come. He didn't know this man. This man had no

**[10:03 - 10:09]** covenant relationship with him. He was a gentile at that time. The covenant at work was with the

**[10:09 - 10:14]** Jewish people. But Jesus loves people and he didn't allow the Lord to keep him from ministering life

**[10:14 - 10:19]** and love. So he said, I'm gonna come. Jesus was repaired. I don't know how long the distance was,

**[10:19 - 10:24]** but he was repaired and leave where he was to go to that man's house and heal him. But the man

**[10:24 - 10:30]** said to Jesus, a centurion said, Lord, you don't have to come. All you have to do is what?

**[10:31 - 10:36]** Just speak the word of my servant will be healed. Jesus looked at this man and he marveled. He said,

**[10:36 - 10:44]** wow. Jesus marveled because everybody of Jesus was dealing with their faith would have required

**[10:44 - 10:52]** him to go to the house. But this man said something that Jesus had never heard any of the Jewish folks

**[10:52 - 11:02]** say. He said, you don't have to come. I know, I know how authority works. I know what authority

**[11:02 - 11:08]** can do. I know that with authority you can command power. And a man in authority doesn't have to

**[11:08 - 11:15]** do anything but speak in order to release power to cause action and results. I'm a man,

**[11:15 - 11:22]** I thought I know how it works. You just need to speak and your words will command power

**[11:23 - 11:29]** enough to heal my son. Wow. That's the revelation you need and that's the revelation I need.

**[11:29 - 11:35]** And if we can grow in this revelation and become as certain as this Roman centurion was

**[11:35 - 11:42]** that all he needed was the word to get the results. My brother and sister, the level of miracles

**[11:42 - 11:47]** and the kind of answers to pray you and I will begin to experience will go to another level.

**[11:48 - 11:55]** Say Lord, open my eyes that I may walk in the revelation that this centurion had

**[11:55 - 12:05]** that all you need to do is to speak. We all know that the way you people in authority

**[12:05 - 12:14]** released power to cause things to be done is simply speaking. And man, you know, whatever happened

**[12:14 - 12:20]** in Venezuela, whether you like it or not, this is not a, I'm making a point so don't get into politics

**[12:20 - 12:29]** here. The point is President Donald Trump didn't go to Venezuela. He's in a position of great

**[12:29 - 12:34]** authority as President of the United States. And all he had to do to cause whatever happened,

**[12:35 - 12:42]** all the power of the U.S. army to be dispatched to accomplish what he wanted because of his authority,

**[12:42 - 12:52]** he just needed to speak. Just words provoked power that produced those results. That's how you

**[12:52 - 13:01]** exercise power. If you're in authority, all you need to do is to speak. You hear me? Words,

**[13:04 - 13:21]** carry authority and worse command power. Say my words, carry authority and command. All right,

**[13:21 - 13:26]** so let's quickly look at some scriptures as I amplified this truth. Genesis chapter 1 verse 3,

**[13:27 - 13:33]** God begins to create the world. And how does he create it? The Bible says,

**[13:33 - 13:42]** and God said, let there be light. And there was life. For the second time, you can go through

**[13:42 - 13:52]** Genesis chapter 1 and every day God created new things and all he did was to speak. Let there be

**[13:53 - 14:03]** and it was. And God said, and it was. Come on, say, and God said, and it was. And God said,

**[14:03 - 14:10]** and it was all went over again. And the scriptures could have just said worse and God said and then

**[14:11 - 14:16]** tell you all the things that God said, but there's a repetition and God said and God said and God said

**[14:17 - 14:24]** and I believe the repetition is for emphasis. The repetition is for revelation. God wants us to

**[14:24 - 14:34]** understand the power of words and how with words we can command light or darkness with words.

**[14:35 - 14:44]** That's how God created everything with his words. And then in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and

**[14:44 - 14:52]** chapter 11, the scripture says that he created all things by the words, all things were framed.

**[14:54 - 15:03]** I hear me? Everything that was created, everything, every star, every planet, everything. And this

**[15:03 - 15:16]** universe is huge. Everything was created just by speech. With his words, he commanded the authority

**[15:16 - 15:23]** and the power that produced everything. Didn't have to get off his throne. Didn't have to move.

**[15:24 - 15:30]** All he had to do was speak and then with words commanded power. Not only did he create the

**[15:30 - 15:37]** promises, even now, everything is being held together by that same word. It is the word of God that

**[15:37 - 15:45]** is manifested in the power that is holding the planets in their position. It is the word of God

**[15:45 - 15:51]** that is exercising the power that is keeping you in your seat. You call it gravity. But gravity

**[15:51 - 16:01]** is the word of God manifest in power that keeps you grounded. And by the way, it can keep you

**[16:01 - 16:07]** grounded spiritually, too. Keep you grounded emotionally. Amen? Say thank God for your word.

**[16:08 - 16:16]** So God by His word created everything. Hallelujah. One of the truths that we need to be

**[16:16 - 16:24]** wrong from this is that God does not use His word to describe reality. God uses His word to create

**[16:24 - 16:35]** reality. I hear me. And that's important because too many of us use our words to describe what we

**[16:35 - 16:43]** see, reality, rather than using our words to create reality. If you want what you see to continue

**[16:43 - 16:53]** to be what you see, keep describing it. No. If you want the condition you're dealing with to

**[16:53 - 16:58]** continue, keep using your mouth and your words only to describe the conditions as they are.

**[17:02 - 17:07]** There was the earth was without form. It was void. Darkness come to the earth. If God had looked at

**[17:07 - 17:14]** it, it's always so dark. Darkness is covering the earth. There is chaos everywhere. You know

**[17:14 - 17:21]** what was going to happen? It was going to get darker. The chaos was going to get greater.

**[17:23 - 17:31]** And many of us not understanding the power of words, use our words to empower and give life,

**[17:32 - 17:41]** the situations that we want to bring to an end. If you and I want to change our circumstances in

**[17:41 - 17:51]** any way or change our lives in any way, we've got to understand that words should not be used

**[17:51 - 17:58]** nearly to describe reality. In fact, as much as possible, use your words to create reality.

**[18:00 - 18:07]** Jesus, in Mark, let me say, if you say to this mountain, be loud, remove, be that cast in the sea.

**[18:07 - 18:14]** Don't doubt in your heart. But you can, but you say it. He says you'll have whatever you say.

**[18:16 - 18:20]** Those are spiritual truths. Those are realities. Those are spiritual laws and the love of God does

**[18:20 - 18:28]** not cancel the power of your speech. What we ought to do is understand the power of words and then

**[18:28 - 18:34]** use our words to tap into the love of God so that we can experience all of those wonderful

**[18:34 - 18:44]** benefits Christ has given us. All right. Say after me, say words are not just sounds. They

**[18:44 - 18:54]** release authority. They command power in Jesus' name. Hallelujah. Now, after creating

**[18:54 - 19:02]** his word, God created man. And before creating man, God said, let us create man in our image.

**[19:04 - 19:11]** And then God said, let him have dominion over the earth. Let him rule the earth. Let him

**[19:11 - 19:18]** govern the earth. Did God say that? So God created man and said, I want man to govern the earth

**[19:18 - 19:25]** and all other created things. Everything you see on earth, every created thing, your dogs,

**[19:25 - 19:34]** my puppies, sonny and rosy and all of those animals, the lions and the bears and all of that,

**[19:34 - 19:44]** God said, I want man to have dominion over them. Now, God created every living thing. And you

**[19:44 - 19:51]** know what? My dogs can have a sense of smell that is much stronger than mine. They smell things

**[19:51 - 19:56]** that I don't smell. They have a sense of hearing. It's amazing. They can hear stuff that I don't hear.

**[19:56 - 20:02]** So in many ways, there's senses they have that they are greater than ours. But there's one thing

**[20:02 - 20:14]** sonny and rosy cannot do. They cannot talk. God reserved the power of speech for man. He gave

**[20:14 - 20:19]** all of these animals abilities greater than ours in so many areas. But one thing he didn't give

**[20:19 - 20:28]** them is the ability to speak because the ability to speak is for the governor. Because he says,

**[20:28 - 20:35]** now I want them to have dominion so I am going to give them the ability to speak because it is

**[20:35 - 20:41]** through the speaking the use of words that they will exercise the authority that will command power

**[20:41 - 20:48]** to be able to govern the earth. It's not by accident that all of these animals don't talk

**[20:48 - 21:00]** because they were not created to rule. They were not created to govern. And so God said, I'm not going

**[21:00 - 21:04]** to give you the ability to speak because I give you the ability to speak. I'm giving you authority

**[21:06 - 21:12]** to command power. The first thing God did then after creating Adam in his image and giving him

**[21:12 - 21:23]** dominion God's, the Bible says God brought all the animals to Adam so that Adam can name them

**[21:25 - 21:29]** and so I don't know what the language Adam spoke but let's assume Adam spoke English.

**[21:30 - 21:35]** If Adam was speaking English he looked at the lion he said lion. He looked at the bear he said

**[21:35 - 21:42]** bear. He looked at the hippopotamus he said and you know every animal he named and the Bible says

**[21:42 - 21:53]** every name that Adam gave to those animals that was the name. Now God was there.

**[21:55 - 22:02]** But the scriptures are very clear God brought the animals to Adam. Why didn't God name the

**[22:02 - 22:09]** animals himself? I have sure God could have come up with much better names that Adam came up with

**[22:11 - 22:16]** because some of the names Adam calls these animals I don't if he was speaking English even I could

**[22:16 - 22:26]** have done better but the Bible says every decision Adam made and whatever Adam said

**[22:26 - 22:39]** you bear you hippopotamus you fish you eagle that was established and God did not interfere.

**[22:41 - 22:49]** Now once the God said no I don't like that name. Once Adam spoke God accepted it. It became so

**[22:50 - 22:59]** why God had given Adam to be an Adam. God had given Adam authority and God had given Adam

**[22:59 - 23:08]** speech so he got exercise at authority so once Adam spoke he was governing. Once Adam spoke he was

**[23:08 - 23:14]** exercise in dominion. Once Adam spoke he was exercises his authority commanding the power to be

**[23:14 - 23:24]** so. God did not interfere because God respected the authority that Adam had to govern the earth.

**[23:24 - 23:33]** Why did God respect it because God gave it to him? Are you hear me? God did not interfere God did not

**[23:33 - 23:40]** change. So at that point Adam begins to call these animals by name and everything he says becomes

**[23:40 - 23:47]** so which means Adam is not governing the earth with his words. He is establishing order.

**[23:47 - 23:57]** He is determining how things operate here and what he is saying God is respecting. So I know sometimes

**[23:57 - 24:04]** we say well if God has allowed us and God is permitting this and the truth is God is not the one

**[24:04 - 24:19]** running earth now. The day will come when our lease will end but for now God is respecting what we

**[24:21 - 24:26]** say. Now that green what you say but respecting your authority and your right to say and exercise

**[24:26 - 24:33]** your authority. So when you choose to speak words of death rather than words of life in a song

**[24:34 - 24:43]** and you can't blame God you could speak words of life. I said before years blessing here's

**[24:43 - 24:52]** death choose life and the way you choose life is with your words right now you should be using

**[24:52 - 25:00]** your words to establish some truth to him. I told you last week silence there were lots of you

**[25:00 - 25:06]** to be silent because you're not exercising an authority when you silent. You're not commanding

**[25:06 - 25:13]** anything when you're silent. I hear me you're not changing anything you're not using your authority

**[25:13 - 25:20]** you're not establishing anything. You're not creating reality when you're silent. You just

**[25:20 - 25:25]** letting things be as they are. And if you like them like they are then maybe you should

**[25:25 - 25:31]** keep your mouth shut because sometimes we small things will open our mouth. If you remember the

**[25:31 - 25:38]** story of Zacharias and John the Baptist's father the angel appeared to him and told him all that God

**[25:38 - 25:42]** was going to do then he began to open his mouth to speak. God the angel said I'm going to shut your

**[25:42 - 25:47]** mouth right now because if I allow you to continue to speak everything I just told you would be put

**[25:47 - 25:57]** a hold. So until this child is born you're not going to say another word. He wasn't punishing him he

**[25:57 - 26:03]** was shutting his mouth out so that God's purpose could be fulfilled. Are you listening to me?

**[26:05 - 26:11]** So God exercises authority he creates reality. He doesn't just use words to describe what is.

**[26:11 - 26:18]** He uses words to create reality. He exercises authority. He can pass power with his words. He

**[26:18 - 26:24]** created Adam in his image gave Adam dominion here and therefore gave Adam and no other animal

**[26:24 - 26:31]** the ability to speak because Adam would exercise dominion and govern on earth with his words and

**[26:31 - 26:41]** that's exactly how you and I are created to function. Amen. The areas over which you have authority

**[26:41 - 26:48]** the way you exercise authority and create realities across God's will to be done in this areas

**[26:48 - 26:56]** is with your words. Notice I said the areas over which you have authority. The things that you

**[26:56 - 27:02]** have authority over and the things that you don't you don't have authority over me. I don't have

**[27:02 - 27:08]** authority over you. I cannot command things to happen in your home and in your family. I can

**[27:08 - 27:15]** command things to happen in my home. If I command things to happen in your life you have to be an

**[27:15 - 27:24]** agreement for them to happen. If you disagree I got to authority. Now you have authority over sin

**[27:24 - 27:30]** you have authority over sickness you have authority over demon so you can command them anytime. Amen

**[27:30 - 27:36]** and when you command them know that hey by words in the name of Jesus have commanded authority and

**[27:36 - 27:42]** the power necessary to do this is is released. So over those things that you and I have been given

**[27:42 - 27:48]** to men and over and authority over we have those are men and authority over other people that we

**[27:48 - 27:53]** can come in agreement. That's what God said we come in agreement and I say and you say and together

**[27:53 - 27:57]** we say the same thing together we're exercising authority and God can actually do more it seems

**[27:58 - 28:06]** when more people are in agreement but what you need to understand is this agreement is with your

**[28:06 - 28:15]** words. Faith is released with words you cannot separate the operation of faith from words

**[28:16 - 28:26]** they're tied together all right so God creates he creates Adam and then the Bible says after he

**[28:26 - 28:32]** creates Adam he breathes into Adam and that's important because you know the Bible doesn't say

**[28:32 - 28:38]** those he breathes into any other animal but he breathes into Adam and that breath that God puts

**[28:38 - 28:48]** into Adam is what gives him the disability to speak and to speak like God you have it you got it

**[28:48 - 28:56]** you capture that so the way God exercises his authority to govern is what words the way

**[28:57 - 29:04]** Adam exercises authority to govern is with words the way men today in positions of authority

**[29:04 - 29:09]** exercise that authority to govern whatever they're governing on the natural level is with words

**[29:09 - 29:16]** I used Donald Trump president as an example and the way you govern the way you govern the way

**[29:16 - 29:22]** you govern your own life and the way you govern your own affairs and the way you govern what happens

**[29:22 - 29:29]** to you is with your words and so if you and I are going to truly benefit from the love of God and all

**[29:29 - 29:37]** that that love provides we've got to understand how important our words are and make a quality

**[29:37 - 29:45]** choice and decision that in 2026 and beyond we're going to speak words that align with God's love

**[29:45 - 29:51]** and God's purpose for us in Jesus name quickly let's go to another scripture because we have a lot

**[29:51 - 29:58]** to cover and I don't know we have to tie first Peter 310 if I go to first go to first Peter 3.9

**[29:58 - 30:04]** and then we'll do 9 and 10 amen but first Peter 3.9 let's read it to Paul Peter speaking to

**[30:04 - 30:08]** Christians that he telling them how to behave and how to conduct themselves but he reveals something

**[30:08 - 30:16]** here about words that I want us to look at let's read it together not returning evil for evil

**[30:16 - 30:25]** or reviling for in other words it's somebody curse you don't curse them back if someone talk

**[30:25 - 30:30]** means or you don't talk mean back to them because someone treats you wrong don't treat them wrong

**[30:30 - 30:35]** that's what he's saying can we agree now you have a choice right you can do it and not do it but

**[30:35 - 30:46]** their consequences okay knowing together let's say that knowing that you are called to this

**[30:46 - 30:55]** that you may what is God's plan and purpose for you that you may do what inherit a blessing what does

**[30:55 - 31:04]** God want for you to inherit a blessing all of us for tip possession of the blessings that you have

**[31:04 - 31:17]** inherited hallelujah so he says don't revive don't curse someone because they curse you go back

**[31:17 - 31:25]** please to the other words but instead you should do what bless in other words you should speak words

**[31:26 - 31:31]** of blessing when he says but on the contrary blessing he means instead of opening your mouth to

**[31:31 - 31:42]** cuss the person who just made you angry open your mouth to say mean things to give them a piece of

**[31:42 - 31:47]** your mind somebody say we have given so many pieces of our mind and way we don't have all of

**[31:53 - 31:59]** God but God is saying do do that you got authority your words release authority and power you need

**[31:59 - 32:09]** to be conscious of that words are not neutral they cost things to happen so he says instead of cussing

**[32:10 - 32:20]** speak words of blessing why because God wants you to take possession of the blessing

**[32:21 - 32:30]** so the words that come under your mouth will impact whether or not you actually take possession

**[32:31 - 32:35]** of the blessings many of us have unclaimed or un-possessed blessings

**[32:37 - 32:43]** they're there they have our name on it but we haven't been able to pick up the parcel

**[32:46 - 32:53]** and Peter is saying one of the reasons you don't have possession or you haven't inherit or you haven't

**[32:53 - 33:00]** taken all of it it's because you don't know how to talk you just let anything come out of your mouth

**[33:00 - 33:07]** you let your feelings to tremor what you say you let your emotions control your speech and because

**[33:07 - 33:11]** you allow your emotions to control your speech you're not enjoying the blessing of God's love

**[33:11 - 33:16]** that blessing is one of the blessings of his love that's your inheritance because he loves you

**[33:16 - 33:22]** but you're not taking possession of it because you're not controlling your speech go to the

**[33:22 - 33:34]** next verse for let's read this together everybody he who would love life and see how many you want

**[33:34 - 33:39]** you you want yeah you love life and you want to see good days no you see some of you not even

**[33:39 - 33:46]** agree raise your hand and say I love life mind you if you're silent and just listening and you're

**[33:46 - 33:52]** not speaking you're not possessing and now I want to keep emphasizing this if all you do is

**[33:52 - 33:58]** listen and hear and get information but you don't open your mouth and begin to speak to exercise

**[33:58 - 34:06]** the authority to command the power that will bring the results you will not possess all you shall

**[34:06 - 34:12]** have whatsoever you say Jesus said when God created the world the power didn't say and God thought

**[34:13 - 34:21]** and God hoped it said and God said so I'm preaching it all you do okay I'm hoping and you just

**[34:21 - 34:31]** you you you're hoping it's that's not that's why I let it alone I wish you received the blessing

**[34:31 - 34:40]** so let's read this now for he who would love life and see good days and that's all of us let him

**[34:41 - 34:49]** refrain his tongue from what evil and his lips from speaking to see lies falsehood

**[34:51 - 34:59]** the other translation says he must refrain he must refrain if you want to experience all

**[34:59 - 35:05]** of the blessings of your inheritance the love of God has provided this scripture is telling you very

**[35:05 - 35:13]** clearly you cannot overlook the power of your speech you cannot be careless with your words

**[35:13 - 35:20]** you can't be talking and cussing people and saying things to people and expect to be able to walk

**[35:20 - 35:29]** in the inheritance you cannot be speaking evil with your lips now what is evil evil is any word

**[35:29 - 35:34]** that comes out of your mouth that contradicts or is not in alignment with what God has said

**[35:34 - 35:40]** or what God has done in Christ and at the time I open my mouth to say something that is not

**[35:40 - 35:46]** in alignment with scripture contradicts what God has said I'm speaking evil and at the time I

**[35:46 - 35:51]** open my mouth to speak things that are not in alignment with what Christ has accomplished for us

**[35:52 - 35:58]** by his death and by his resurrection is evil and that will prevent us from being able to take

**[35:58 - 36:08]** possession of what God has given freely secondly anything you speak that is contrary to God's

**[36:08 - 36:18]** nature God is love so wherever I open my mouth to speak things that contradict God's love nature

**[36:18 - 36:31]** to speak unkind things I am speaking evil and by so doing I am not refraining my tongue

**[36:32 - 36:39]** I'm using my lips in a way that is actually going to block and hinder and prevent or delay the

**[36:39 - 36:50]** blessing God has already prepared with my name on it you you understand so again when you cussing

**[36:52 - 37:05]** or you say things mean to one another you're actually hindering your blessings that's why

**[37:05 - 37:10]** even when it comes to husband and wife God says to a piece fully with them so your prayers

**[37:11 - 37:18]** cannot be hindered again he's talking about your words because when my wife and I are fussing

**[37:18 - 37:40]** we're using words I always say good things to her amen amen but you but that's reality let's

**[37:40 - 37:50]** laugh and have fun but this is life and death matters so do what guard your lips the Baba says life

**[37:50 - 38:02]** and death are where in the power of the tongue that's Proverbs 1821 says life and death in the power

**[38:02 - 38:14]** that the so with your tongue you can attract life or you can attract death why does the words have

**[38:14 - 38:23]** that kind of power because words think of words also as containers all right and our words carry

**[38:25 - 38:48]** faith hope and love our words can also carry fear hopelessness and hatred I can release faith with my

**[38:48 - 38:56]** words hope with my words love with my words and when I do that those are the things that the Holy

**[38:56 - 39:07]** Spirit works with and so when my words are releasing faith and hope and love my words are creating

**[39:08 - 39:17]** the environment in which the Holy Spirit who is the spirit of life works so my words then

**[39:18 - 39:28]** so have the power of life but if I release with my words instead of love hatred instead of faith

**[39:28 - 39:41]** fear instead of hope despair those words create the environment that allow when I speak faith

**[39:41 - 39:49]** and I speak hope and I speak love God shows up to manifest Himself in my situation I'm introducing

**[39:49 - 39:57]** God's love into my circumstances but when I speak fear and I speak hatred and I speak despair guess

**[39:57 - 40:07]** who comes knocking demons come knocking at the door but this is true and so with our words we're

**[40:07 - 40:12]** creating the conditions that can allow the spirit of life to work all the spirit of death to work in

**[40:12 - 40:27]** our circumstances go to James chapter 1 verse 26 please we've got to land this plane but let's

**[40:27 - 40:37]** look at this let's read it together if anyone among you thinks he is religious and does not want

**[40:37 - 40:46]** bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart this once religion is useless one for just a worthless

**[40:48 - 40:57]** you know what that verse is said means you can come to church every Sunday you can pay your

**[40:57 - 41:02]** tithe or I don't like paying you can give your tithe worship with your tithe and with your offerings

**[41:03 - 41:11]** every Sunday you can do a lot of good religious things you can visit the poor you can do all of

**[41:11 - 41:20]** those things and those things are good he says but if you don't bridle your tongue if you don't

**[41:20 - 41:27]** accept controls on your tongue if you do not allow your tongue to speak under that which is

**[41:27 - 41:34]** consistent with who God is his word and his finish works if you just talk and let your feelings

**[41:34 - 41:40]** control your speech he says everything else that you're doing doesn't matter you it's worthless if

**[41:40 - 41:54]** you're destroying everything you're building so you can you know we're fasting right now and praying

**[41:54 - 42:03]** and God is hearing prayer but no matter how much we fast and how much we pray if we don't bridle

**[42:03 - 42:16]** our tongue if we continue to speak nothing but unbelief hatred helplessness if we just keep

**[42:16 - 42:31]** describing what is our prayer fasting would be useless are you listening so what are you going

**[42:31 - 42:36]** to do you have to make some decisions let's go to one more and then we're done go to James

**[42:36 - 42:44]** chapter three I believe it begins as verse two I hope I'm right James chapter three yes okay James

**[42:44 - 42:50]** again is speaking about speech let's read together please so we all stumble in many things

**[42:50 - 43:00]** if anyone does not stumble in word he is a perfect man a mature man able to bride of the whole body

**[43:00 - 43:04]** some of the problems you're having with the lust of the flesh the reason why you continue to act

**[43:04 - 43:12]** the way you act and you keep committing the same sins over over it's with it's with your mouth it's

**[43:12 - 43:22]** what you're saying that is causing your body to be able to do what it does so he says if you want

**[43:22 - 43:29]** to control your body start with your mouth if you want to control your behavior the power

**[43:29 - 43:42]** deduces in your mouth instead of saying I'm a sinner so I say I'm righteous so I say I'm loved by

**[43:42 - 43:51]** God start saying I'm holy in God's sight start saying I am the temple of the living God

**[43:52 - 44:00]** I hear me start agreeing with God's word concerning who he is what is that who you are start with

**[44:00 - 44:07]** your words coming into alignment with God's word and God's the finished word and you'll find that

**[44:07 - 44:14]** your body will start to conform it may not happen overnight but if you keep speaking that word

**[44:14 - 44:20]** and keep speaking that word you are releasing the authority you are exercising your authority

**[44:20 - 44:25]** you're commanding things to happen and because you have authority to govern your life in the

**[44:25 - 44:32]** corners of God's word things will begin to come into alignment and they will come when you when

**[44:32 - 44:37]** you try to do that thing you will find I can't get no more joy no more pleasure out of that it's

**[44:37 - 44:52]** gone and man you guys are not saying amen anymore he's able to bridle the whole body that's going

**[44:52 - 45:00]** quickly we are running out of time quickly quickly let's go three okay he's taken to wild so here's

**[45:00 - 45:08]** a point this chapter is going to say that the tongue is like a rudder that can turn

**[45:08 - 45:17]** the rudder does what it turns the ship have you seen how big a ship is a rudder how big is a rudder

**[45:18 - 45:26]** I haven't seen one but it's small but the captain can turn that thing around it can be going north

**[45:26 - 45:32]** and he can make it turn completely to go south and all he has to do is turn the rudder and the rudder

**[45:32 - 45:41]** will turn the ship if you're driving your car if you want to go east what do you do you turn east

**[45:42 - 45:46]** you determine where you want to go and then you stare in that direction and that causes the car

**[45:46 - 45:54]** to go where you wanted to go this is what he's saying he's saying your tongue the words that you say

**[45:54 - 46:02]** was set the direction of your life and if your life is headed in the direction that you don't

**[46:02 - 46:12]** want it to go you have authority in your mouth with your words so determine the change that you

**[46:12 - 46:21]** want to happen and with your words you can literally tap into the power of God that would turn your

**[46:21 - 46:29]** vessel completely now that ship doesn't turn if it's going south it takes a while

**[46:30 - 46:39]** for it to make a you turn by the minute the rudder is turning begins to move and so some things

**[46:39 - 46:46]** will happen quickly in your life and some things may take a while but don't turn the rudder

**[46:49 - 46:57]** away from where you want to keep the rudder where you want it to go keep your mouth where you want

**[46:57 - 47:04]** to go don't let the feelings in the circumstances cause you say aye it's not working

**[47:08 - 47:13]** no this is where I want to go I want to live a whole life I want to live a righteous life I want

**[47:13 - 47:18]** to live a victorious life I want to fulfill God's purpose I want to do God's will I want to

**[47:18 - 47:25]** fulfill my destiny I want to experience the promises of God I want my life to glorify God and that's

**[47:25 - 47:36]** where you want the change will begin in your mouth so open your mouth and begin to speak what

**[47:36 - 47:44]** the word of God says and every time you do that you are exercising spiritual authority

**[47:44 - 47:50]** that is commanding spiritual power in order to bring about the results that God has promised you

**[47:51 - 47:59]** and that the love of God makes available to you in Christ Jesus do you receive it say hallelujah

**[48:00 - 48:08]** are you do us of the word or hear us only you are do us of the word and man you need to say that

**[48:08 - 48:16]** you see if you want to be a do of the word say I'm a doer of the word men of you are struggling

**[48:16 - 48:22]** and you seem never to be able to overcome and it's because you keep describing what you have

**[48:24 - 48:36]** you keep describing you you're not saying what God says and man this verse or this passage tells you

**[48:36 - 48:44]** you know if you if you say I don't know how I will make it through this difficult time no job

**[48:44 - 48:53]** what you've done you scared the ship towards the rocks but if you say my God supplies all my needs

**[48:53 - 48:58]** according to his riches and glory I don't care what's happening on the outside the Lord is my

**[48:58 - 49:03]** shepherd I should not want are you hear me if you said Jesus it's a supply of this need I got

**[49:03 - 49:09]** Jesus I already got if he said the word of God has been spoken he cannot return for it you have

**[49:09 - 49:17]** shared that ship into an open seed of provision and the doctor said you're sick and we you know

**[49:17 - 49:22]** we can't help you and and every time everybody you meet you say oh the doctor said I'm sick

**[49:23 - 49:30]** and he can't help me you've got no reason to say you just saying it I mean I mean if you if you

**[49:30 - 49:35]** are dealing with illness and you need to say it to a doctor because the doctor needs to know so

**[49:35 - 49:44]** he that's one thing but everywhere you go you just oh I'm sickle the doctor said oh you know

**[49:44 - 49:50]** they're treating me oh oh but the problem if that's all you're talking you are simply reinforcing

**[49:50 - 49:58]** that reality that you don't want to change I'm not saying I'm not saying deny what is but

**[49:59 - 50:06]** only talk about what is only because it's necessary but spend your time speaking about the reality

**[50:06 - 50:12]** that you are believing and creating that you know the love of God has already made provision for

**[50:12 - 50:19]** and let your mouth continually declare God's word so instead of saying everything the doctor

**[50:19 - 50:26]** say you know I but about the stripes of Jesus I'm healed but I'm going to live and not die

**[50:27 - 50:31]** but are you hear me you're supposed to do all of that and I die then go to heaven

**[50:35 - 50:42]** amen but what if you do all of that and you let because you do what if you keep talking about

**[50:42 - 50:47]** your problem and you die because you keep talking about your problem make a choice which is better

**[50:48 - 51:00]** speak life amen and we have a powerful example of that evangelist Billy Gray I'm Billy Gray

**[51:00 - 51:08]** if I just a Billy Bimba that man should be dead you know how many times cancer I mean

**[51:09 - 51:16]** attacks him and I mean the only reason Billy Bimba is alive is because he refused to stop saying

**[51:17 - 51:27]** I will live and not die I mean he said that when the pain he said that when the condition was

**[51:27 - 51:34]** getting worse he said that when the medicine wasn't working man I take my ass off to him

**[51:34 - 51:43]** because to go through that and not paint but his words

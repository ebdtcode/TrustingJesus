this day, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, this whole area needs the gospel. All right, so let's go to Romans chapter 5 verse 1 and 2. Hallelujah. I want to begin today and next week and we'll see how long the Lord keeps us in the book of Romans. But I want to reinforce and relay, so to speak, the foundation upon which our faith is built. All of us needs to be grounded in this truth. Let's read together. Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Haven't been justified by faith, we have what? Peace with God. What do we have? Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Let's go to verse 2. Through home also, we have what? Access by faith into this grace in which we stand and we do what? Rejoice in hope of the glory of God through the Lord Jesus Christ. We have peace with God. We have access into the grace in which we stand. And we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. There was a story I heard many, many years ago called a peace child. I don't know how many of you may have heard the story of the peace child. It made it a very powerful story of missionaries who went to, I think, the Saudi people in one of the nations in South America. And they were trying to share the gospel with these folks, but they couldn't get through. Because in that particular culture, betrayal, like what Judas did was a virtue. So when you told the story of how Jesus was betrayed by Judas, the hero for them was Judas, not Jesus. So how do you communicate the gospel to such of people when the hero is Judas? The betrayer, not Jesus. And so they could not make any headway in reaching these Saudi people for Christ until the Lord showed them something as they were praying for a breakthrough in the culture of the Saudi people that was the way through which the gospel could be communicated and understood by them. The village that they were trying to reach was at war with another village. And this had lasted for some time. And then finally the two kings or kings decided to make peace. And at the time when they were making peace, he observed, the missionary observed that one king took his son and gave his son to the king of the other tribe. And this son was called a peace child because according to their custom, the fact that they had given their son and the other tribe had accepted it had somehow made them one. And as long as the peace child was alive, there would be and could be no war between them. And when he saw that God opened his eyes, he said, tell them Jesus is the peace child. In man, that this war that existed between God and man as a result of man's sin and rebellion, this war that had gone on for thousands and thousands of years, tell them that God had provided the peace child. And then as long as the peace child was alive, God would be at peace with men. And if they would accept the peace child, there would be a cessation of hostilities, the end of war and God and the sinner would be at peace. Raise your hand and thank God for the peace child. Hallelujah. And here's the gospel if we accept Jesus, God's peace child. As long as he is a life for all those who accept him, there always would be peace between God and that man. That is the gospel in a nutshell. We have peace with God because we have Christ Jesus. And he is not only the one who makes peace himself is our peace. And as long as Jesus Christ is alive, the man who believes in him and accepts him will exist in a state of perpetual peace with God. This doctrine of the peace with God that Paul speaks of here is the bedrock of the Christian life. It's the most fundamental blessing of being Christ upon which all other hopes and joys are built. Hallelujah. And so we need to be grounded in this revelation that the war that once existed between God and man, that caused God to withdraw, caused God to put barriers, caused God to not draw close to man, caused God to deal with man from a distance. That war has ceased. Metaphorically, the bombs have stopped falling. You hear me? You know, we look at the wars that are taking place right now in Ukraine and Russia and many of us long. And we say, when will this stop? When will the bombs stop falling? This state of enmity will it ever end? Well, it was far more serious than that when man seen a rebellion in God. And the consequences were far worse than even what we're viewing and what we're seeing. That's taking place now in Israel and taking place in Ukraine. This enmity existed between man and God because of man seen a rebellion. Man that that man was the under the judgment of God and was destined to face nothing but the wrath of God. That was what was in his future. But thank God that has changed. Say hallelujah. All of this has changed because Jesus Christ the Son of God the peace child has changed everything. That touches my heart. I don't know if it touches your heart. Maybe I spent a little bit more time meditating upon it. Maybe that's what is touching my heart right now. But let me see it again. Say Jesus Christ the peace child has changed everything. Everything. It meant about us and our relationship with God has been completely transformed. The bombs are no longer dropping. The war has ended. The enmity that exists between God and man due to our sin no longer exists for the man who is in Christ. If you're not in Christ that condition unfortunately still exists. But if you are in Christ there is no war between you and God. There are no bombs falling. Are you hear me? If you are in Christ because of the peace child Christ has changed your relationship with God forever and God now is completely pleased with us. He has nothing in his mind or in his heart against us for which he is angry and for which he's planning to punish us. God is not fighting against you in Christ. Say Hallelujah. God in Christ is not offended by your sins. He's not withholding his love. He's not withholding himself. He's not withholding his favors in any way manner shape a form. All charges that he once had against us for our transgressions have been dropped completely. I feel you clapping the rest of you struggling. I said in Christ because of the peace child all charges God once had against us as a result of our rebellion, our transgressions have been what dropped completely. We are at peace with God because God is at peace with us. Say Hallelujah. But it means more than the war has ended. It means more than the charges have been dropped. It means more than God is not angry with us. The fact that we have peace with God means not just the absence of punishment and judgment but it means the presence of good will. It means God is positively on our side. He's not just not angry but neutral. No. He's gone from being at war to being not at war to be absolutely 100% for us. Romans chapter 8 says if God be what? Yeah God is not just not against us. The peace child has so transformed the nature of our relationship with God that not only is God not against us God is positively for us on our side. And the scripture says in Romans chapter 8, nothing can separate us from the love of God. But Romans 1, let's read, I want these folks to see this stuff. Go to Romans 8 1. What then shall we say to these things? Excuse me, not one, what verse is that? Verse, verse, chapter 1, go to verse 31, please. What then shall we say to these things? Let's read it together. What then shall we say to these things if God is for us? In other words, Paul has spent all of the time up to this particular verse laying down the gospel and all that the peace child Jesus has accomplished. And after teaching that and preaching that and explaining what Jesus has done, he says now as a result of everything you heard, Jesus has done what then? So we say, we need to respond to this glorious gospel. He says, if God, that's why you ought to be saying, come on, you ought to be saying that. I don't know what you're going through. I don't know what a devil is telling you. I don't know what condemnation and guilt you are under. I don't know why you you are feeling depressed and discouraged and all of that. But Paul said if we understand the gospel and what the peace child has accomplished, then instead of a cry, we've been feeling sorry for ourselves, distress, discouraged, letting the devil condemn us, we ought to be saying to ourselves, we ought to be saying to the demons, we ought to be saying to our circumstances, we ought to be saying to our feelings, look, if God is for me, who can be against me? Otherwise, who or what can be against me successfully? Amen. Who can prevail? What can prevail? If God is literally for me on my side. Let's read the next verse. Let's go. He, who did not spare, he thought you're a stand-up, stand-up, stand-up, stand-up. We've got to read this thing, make a person, don't just read the words. I mean, you need to hear yourself saying this. This is the answer to what you are dealing with. This truth can set you free. Let's read it together. He, who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up. How? How so he not with him? Also freely, come and talk to yourself. I do right now against the enemy who wants you to believe otherwise. Talk to yourself. Talk to yourself. Okay, since you don't want to talk to yourself, talk to your neighbor. Tell your neighbor, how so he not with him, free that give you all things. Listen to me, guys. If God loved you so much that he could not withhold, even Jesus, if it's loved that I permit him to withhold even Jesus, how can God not help you? How can God forsake you? How can God leave you on your own? I mean, if God was going to withhold anything from you, it was going to be his only begotten son. If God looked at Jesus, I love you Jesus, but I cannot even withhold you. They need help and you, the only one who can help them. If that was God's attitude in sending Christ brothers and sisters, how can you doubt that he is involved and concerned and say to your neighbor, it's going to be all right. Let's read the next verse. Who shall bring a charge against God? It is who? God, listen to me. You see, we talk about salvation. You don't justify yourself. If you could justify yourself, then here I mean, you will have to be able to argue with those who bring charges against you to prove that you are good enough. And you will lose that case. But here is the good news. Here's the gospel. This is what you need to grab and so many don't. It is God himself who has declared you righteous in his sight. Let's go on. Who is he? You know what that means? It means it is not God who condemns. You need to decide. Either it is God justifying you or God condemning you but God cannot do both. And if you say God is condemning you, that means you don't believe in the peace child. You have in essence rejected the gospel. You have in essence rejected all that Christ did. If you allow yourself or the enemy to say God is condemning you to hell. In Christ. So you got to make a choice. Are you going to believe that God is condemning you? In which case you are doubting the sufficiency of Christ's mediaturial work? He failed. Oh, he said, no, Jesus didn't fail. On the cross Jesus sounded it is. Come on everybody. It is. Hey, it is Christ who died. And furthermore, why is Christ risen? Because he have got approved the sacrifice. If Jesus had failed to offer a sacrifice acceptable to God by which God could justify you, Jesus would have remained in the grave. The resurrection proves that the sacrifice was accepted. The resurrection proves that God is no longer angry. God is no longer condemning. God is no longer judging. God is no longer punishing all those who believe in his son. Say hallelujah. Say the name of Jesus Christ is risen. Therefore I am justified. Declare righteous in the Son of God. But it doesn't stop there. It is Jesus who does what also makes so Jesus died for you. Jesus arose for you. Jesus is at the right hand of God. It is just sitting for you. And then you say, I'm sucking them. That is your gospel. That is no gospel. It is in fact a rejection of the gospel. Nice words. Oh, come on. Everybody who shall separate us from the love of Christ, shall, shall distress, shall prosecution, shall, shall naked up. What is the answer next verse? Next verse. As it is written for your sick, we are killed all day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Next verse. Yes. In all these things. Come on. Let's say in all these things. We are what? More through here. Who made you more than Kakara? Him. So if you doubt that you are more than a Kakara, you are doubting him. You see, peace with God, salvation, justification are all the work of Christ. And that's why it is sore. It is secure. You can go to the bank on it. We could take you at one time and read the rest of it. But please be seated. Raise your heads. Thank God. Paul concluded by saying for I am persuaded that neither death nor light nor angels nor principalists nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creative thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is can we just can we just settle it? Can we just settle? Yes, the gospel is that good. What Jesus did was was that complete? Can we just settle this today? So the devil can never again mess with you or mess with your mind? Amen. If you're in Christ, nothing should be able to separate you from what? You didn't just say it from God. But from the love of God which means nothing will stop God from loving you. And love is not a feeling. Love is, love is goodness, active goodness. Love is a verb. It is something you're not saying what I'm saying. Amen. When the Bible says the love of God it's not talking about just a feeling in God's heart. It's talking about God working positively for you, promoting your interests, watching over you, seeking your well-being. Nothing will ever stop God from doing that. Because of, say thank God for the peace of God. None of this will be possible had Jesus not been given. So he's not only the one who makes peace. He himself is, now I think all of us are familiar with the prodigal son, right? You know the story but that's the picture of what it means to be saved. That's the picture of what peace with God looks like. You know how this prodigal son left home. Rebuild that against his father. I don't want to be in your authority. I don't want to listen to you. I don't want to do what you say. I want to make my own decisions run my own life. Lead me along. Give me. Let me go. And he left. And he spent his life. Don't what he wanted to do by the wages of sin. His death sinless evil sin has consequences. And he came to the place where he had lost everything. And then the Bible says he came to his senses. And he said, you know what? Even the slaves, the servants in my father's house have enough to eat in the spirit. I don't deserve. I don't earn. I don't merit. My father doesn't have any responsibility anymore to do anything for me because I rebuild against him. I rejected him. I thrown away what he gave me. But I'm going to go and just ask for mercy. I said, father, please, I'm not worthy. I haven't done anything to deserve you to take me back into your family. I'm not even asking that you will make me a son. Please just make me a slave. Let me be a servant because at least I will have food to eat. That was his mentality. He starts making his way home. His father does not even wait for him to get to the house because the father says the father saw him while he was a father, which means the father was looking down that road every day waiting for his son to come home. Hallelujah. And when the father spotted him, he did not, he was like, okay, I will wait and see what he will do. The father says the father literally ran. And back then, you know, the Jewish people, it wasn't you know, a responsible man didn't run. But that father laid aside all his dignity. He didn't care what they said. He didn't care what the people said. It meant all he knew his son was on his way. And he ran. And you know, one of the reasons he ran was because according to the tradition, the village people had seen him, the son first, they had a right according to the law to stone him to death. So that father's, I'm going to get to him with grace before the law gets to him. And they saw us saying, say, hallelujah. And the father rushed us and literally, oh, you got to all of us right here. You need to understand that's why we're here. The father ran. In Christ Jesus, the father didn't wait for you to come. Hallelujah. The father says, while we were yet enemies, God gave his son for us. He didn't wait for us to run. He ran and he embraced the prodigal son, brought him back home, never asked a boy one question. Put the road back, put the shoes on, put the ring back, killed the father's calf. My son was lost and he is fine. In other words, he treated his boy like he had never left. He treated him like he had never left. He treated him like he had never once sinned. He treated him as though he had never rebuilt. He treated him as though he's always been this faithful, loving son at home. That's a picture of what it means to have peace with God. That is what the peace child comes to hallelujah. That is what the peace child has accomplished. Henceforth, this is how you must see God. And this is how you must see your relationship to him in Christ Jesus. The peace child has truly made peace with God for us. Now God treats us as though we never left home. He treats us exactly as he would treat Jesus. What it means to have peace with God. And what Paul is saying, Romans 5, when he says, grasp this, they hold of this reality, understand it. And whenever your mind accuses you in such a way that will cause you to doubt your relationship with Christ, your salvation. This is the truth that you must stand on. See, I have in Christ. Now, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I want to develop this more next week as I'm already running out of time. But here me, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. That means this peace that we're talking about before it may represent is only possible because of Jesus. Why? Because this peace with God have to be secured legally. You hear me? No one respects the law more than God. That's why Jesus I didn't come to abolish the law. I came to fulfill it. No matter how much God loves us, God would never allow his love to get in the way of the law. And everything his love motivated him to do, he had to do it legally. He had to follow the law to the teeth. And you know how strict the law is because the law is the expression of holiness. And so that's peace that you have with God. It's not the result of some emotional feeling that God had. God may have been emotional about it, but God could not establish it without doing it legally or he himself would have been a law breaker. So in order to establish this peace, God had to do it according to the law. And God followed the law to the teeth. You hear me? That is why because this is what the law says. The law says the soul that sin is shall die. And the law says without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sin. That is why I hear me. God has never once forgiven anybody of any sin apart from blood. It would have been totally illegal for God to say I love you. So I'm going to establish peace with you with our requiring blood because he had he done that. He would have been disrespecting the law. And the law is the moral expression that governs the universe. So the peace we have with God is not an emotional thing. I know you know as a parent you just move by emotion you can forgive your children. But this is a legal matter. It's one thing when they transgress against you personally, but it's another thing when they break the law. And the separation between God and man was not just an emotional thing, it's a legal thing. And so the peace you had had to be obtained legally. God had to follow the law and establish peace in accordance to the law or it would not have any validity. It could then be questioned you got no grounds to stand on. Now you listen to me. If you own a piece of land and somebody comes to claim that land, hopefully you have the deed. And the deed you have is valid and is legal. You can get your deed and you can show your deed. And in a court of law, you can possess your land because you own it legally. Not emotional. Not one of my father gave it to me. Where's the deed? It's been always in my family. Where is the deed? I hear me. So you got to understand if somebody's trying to take your land, you pull out your legal deed and you got to go to court, you go to court with it. And then you can present the deed, you win the case. When the enemy comes to challenge your peace with God, you need to know this peace is not an emotional thing. My father didn't just give this to me because of his emotions. No, this peace is mine legally. Amen. And you got to be able to go to the word and produce the deed. Amen. Because the word is the legal document. You got to go to Romans 5.1 and say listen here it is. We have peace with God. Romans 5.1. And we have peace with God through Jesus Christ. Through Jesus Christ, it's shorthand. For say everything that Christ was in is the basis for our peace. The incarnation, he became man, the substitutionary death on the cross, the shedding of his blood, death, in order to satisfy the condition of the law, the russ erection, the ascension, the presentation of the blood, the legal verdict, rendered in the court of heaven. I'm not guilty of it. It's the basis for my peace with God. It's a legal thing. I have a right to it. The law was paid for the army guys. I really want to drive on this point. The peace you have with God was obtained by God through Jesus Christ in accordance to the dictates of the law. In other words, God, the righteous judge, the holy God. Are you hear me? Who is so holy himself to sin? Who hates sin? This holy God who agrees with the law that the soul that sin is shall die. This holy God who agrees with the law, that without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sin because sin is that serious in order for him to give peace to sinners, how to satisfy the law. So hear me. Use your imagination a little bit. God, the judge sits in the court of heaven that governs the universe and he has to examine the evidence and the evidence of your sins are presented to him and the evidence of my sins are presented to him and the condemnation and the sentence of the law is presented to him. He sees the evidence, your guilty, you broke the law, but then comes in our defense lawyer, Jesus. And Jesus, whole objective is to get us forgiven, to get us to be set free, but he must provide evidence according to the law. And so he produces the evidence that the law that requires death and blood has already been satisfied. He must convince God the judge that the claims of the law have been satisfied. And so now he must bring his broken body, he must bring his own blood and he must bring his sinless life because had he sinned his blood could not atone for sinners. So Jesus had to bring before God and God had to examine the life of Jesus. From the day he was conceived in the womb to the day he died, God had to examine his life and see that throughout his incarnation, not once said he ever sinned, not once said he ever buy like any commandment of God, that throughout his life he loved God with all of his heart, all of his mind, all of his soul, all of his strength, he fulfilled the law completely, not once said he break in the law, but beyond that he obeyed God properly. God had to examine that because at Jesus, sinned even once, the law would have rejected his claim and we would have remained under condemnation, no peace with God. Thank God. Jesus met the requirement. I say he's the Lamb of God. He met the requirement because he's the spotless Lamb of God. He is the perfect Lamb of God. He is the sinless Lamb of God. He met every condition of obedience, every condition of righteousness. He is the only one of whom it can be said he had no sin. Therefore the law had no right to judge him or put him to death for sin but the law accepted him as a substitute and the law sentenced him to death because what the law wanted was blood. It could be the blood of the sinner or the blood of a righteous man, but put sins to be forgiven, life and blood must be shared or justice is not done. Christ provided the perfect sacrifice shed his blood and he presented that to the Father. So the Father weighed the law and its sentence of death, the shedding of blood as is requirement for the forgiveness of sin, the Father examines the evidence of Jesus' life, his broken body, his shared blood and he says by virtue of his death, his broken body and his shared blood the law concerning death has been fulfilled. And on the basis of that the Lord no longer has any claim against sinners. Therefore there is no peace between me and them because there is peace between them and the law. Come erase your head, say hallelujah, glory be to God, we will continue next week. But let me stop here and let me reinforce this fact. You have peace with God. In other words you are saved. In other words you are no longer under condemnation. In other words you're no longer under judgment. In other words you're no longer going to face the wrath of God that is to come upon the world because you have accepted the peace child. You have peace with God. This is your position with God. This is how God views you. We have what peace with God. That's why you know when you die you're going to have it because you got what? Peace with God. Why do you have peace with God? Not because of your works but because of the peace child. So now through Jesus you have peace with God and then it says through Jesus you have access to this grace in which we stand. Because you see the question the question that one might be tempted to ask. So okay if now the sin that I've committed I have been paid for. Doesn't that mean now it's okay for me to sin because you just saved in Christ because of what Christ did not what I did. I have peace with God. Since the peace I have with God is a legal one that was accomplished because Christ already died from my sins. Hey I can now sin and the more I sin the more the grace of God can be celebrated because we can show how gracious God is to say that some people foolish enough think that way. So that's why I would do with adding Romans after 6.1. So we continue to sin that grace made about and Paul says you're foolish. You're stupid. Paul almost cussed. You know yesterday we were having this meeting and says at 12 o'clock but saying something she said my wife said. I said no my wife didn't say that. But Paul almost said that here. You hear me? Amen. But Paul said you stupid. How would you say that don't you know that you are actually dead to sin? How can you who are dead to sin live any longer than we'll talk about that. I hear me. But the reason you're dead to sin is because through the one by whom you have peace you also have access to this grace. In which you stand listen every child of God is standing in grace living in grace standing on grace. You are the beneficiary of the grace of God. When God makes peace with you through Christ through the same Jesus he gives you access to grace. The other one you're standing now in grace and grace doesn't leave you the way it met you. Say hallelujah you see because one of the things motivating God in saving us the Bible says is that we can be married to Christ who is grace so that we can bring fruit unto God that fruit is holiness. So he makes peace that he joins you to Christ and then through your union with Christ you start to bear fruit that looks like Jesus. Say hallelujah when a husband and a wife make children their children are human. If you marry a man and you become pregnant for that man you will have a child that is human after his kind. You got to understand you see he makes peace with us then by grace he makes us one with the one who is holy and through our union with him we begin to bring fruit that looks like him so the Bible says what a man receives grace stands in grace it's a recipient of grace it's a result of the operation of God's grace in his or her life the Bible says sin loses its power over that man. In other words the grace of God the grace of God breaks the power of sin. How you hear me the Bible says he begins to work in you both the will and the do that's the work of grace grace gets on the inside of you grace begins to work in your life and all of a sudden your desires begin to change are you hear me you no longer desire the things you use to desire now you become a new appetite are you hear me and the Bible says grace will teach you to say no I am preaching better than you listening say hallelujah say hallelujah say hallelujah the wonderful thing is now my transformation is taking place from the inside out I'm not just adding things to me I'm fundamentally being changed from glory to glory into the image of Christ who is holy so this grace you stand in because you have peace with God will teach you to say no to sin no to ungodliness in other words no to anything that doesn't look like God no to anything that doesn't talk like God no to anything that doesn't walk like God and when you're standing in grace you begin to wonder what's happening are you so enjoyed the night comes now when I go there I feel like I could be sleeping resting what am I doing here and man the things you used to be chasing after trying to get purpose trying to get meaning chasing love you no longer need them because you are satisfied by the love of God the life of God are you hearing the spirit of God if any man be in Christ he is a new creation all things are passed away and all things become all right as you can see after three weeks I got a lot to say amen but we'll stop here no we'll continue next week but I really want to stay in Romans because I want to establish and reestablish and remind ourselves of what we have because of the peace child and then I hope you and I guess so full of this revelation we can't keep it to ourselves I mean I hope we just become so joyful and so excited by the love of God the grace of God the goodness of God nobody got to tell us to tell someone else about Jesus amen no one got to say child people have come to harvest because you know when they come they're going to hear the gospel they're going to meet Jesus they're in kind of Jesus so that you're motivated from within I pray we get there so let's be praying that this series will produce that result and don't miss it don't stay home don't come once on it don't come the next pee here and then just don't come alone next week you know what people are going to hear and bring somebody we're talking about eternal things here guys and the world desperately needs this gospel again and it's sad there are many people in many churches some even in our harvest churches who are in our midst but they stole that of us they're still lost because for them and I didn't get to it the Bible says we access this by faith for them for all of this to happen to me with our God demanding that I do something it's too good to be true and for that reason they do not believe it and because they do not believe it they're not saved because if you do not believe that all of this is through Jesus Christ if you are now willing to simply accept it if you feel you've got to do something to compete you have in essence denied it that is a rejection of a gospel you hear me we access it by faith faith is simply an empty hand that accepts what Christ has done I say thank you raise your hands if father I thank you for this truth I pray that the Holy Spirit will continue to reinforce the revelation of my peace with God through Jesus Christ may I live each day conscious of this peace in Jesus name now when this piece is the foundation upon which you are building everything then this peace with God changes your relationship with yourself with others with trials even with death it changes all of that because of this revelation come next week we'll build on this in Jesus

## Summary

Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivers a powerful sermon on biblical meditation as the most critical spiritual discipline for believers. Using Joshua 1:8 as his foundation, he explains that meditation is essential for spiritual growth, emotional health, and fulfilling God's purpose. The bishop teaches that meditation is both prayer and worship, and it's the fuel that empowers all other spiritual practices. He provides practical instruction on how to move God's Word from the head to the heart through meditation, using relatable illustrations like thermostats, sponges, and tea bags. The message emphasizes that transformation comes not just from reading Scripture, but from meditating on it day and night, allowing the Word to renew our minds and change our behavior from the inside out.

## Key Points

### 1. Meditation is the Most Important Spiritual Discipline

- Required for good success in executing God's will
- Cannot fulfill purpose through reading alone

### 2. Meditation is Prayer and Worship
- One of the highest forms of prayer
- An act of worship in itself
- The fuel that sets other prayers and worship on fire
- Produces revelation that empowers other spiritual practices

- Same skill applied to God's Word produces transformation

### 6. The Mind as a Thermostat
- You have power to set your mind
- Can change from worry to peace, fear to faith
- Set your mind on God's promises, grace, who you are in Christ
- Romans 8: Mind set on Spirit = life and peace

### 7. Practical Steps for Meditation

**The Process:**
- Read/hear the Word (enters the head)
- Focus attention on a truth, promise, or aspect of God
- Repeat, review, rehearse the truth
- Speak it, declare it
- Keep it before your eyes (imagination)
- See yourself living that truth

## Important Quotes

"You cannot fulfill your purpose and your assignment if you're not going to practice what God has said."

"The word doesn't change you if it enters your head and stays there. For the word of God to produce the transformation in you that will cause you to observe that word and therefore bear fruit success, it has to move from your head to your heart."

"If you can change those thoughts and change those emotions, your behavior will follow."

"If you know how to worry, you know how to meditate."

"Your brain is like a thermostat. You have the power to decide where you're going to set your mind."

"Stop dipping and start soaking. Stop skimming and start meditating in God's Word."

"The more you suck on the Word, the sweeter it will become."

## Context Notes

**Church Situation:**
The bishop acknowledges government-related challenges affecting church members financially. He announces that instead of the regular "invest beyond" offering, the service will receive a benevolence offering to help members in need. He encourages members to be sensitive to one another's needs during this time.

**Practical Application:**
After every sermon, identify what God wants you to know, believe, or what old thoughts need replacing. Capture those truths and meditate on them throughout the week. Use your imagination to see yourself living out those truths.

## Transcript

[The following is the complete word-for-word transcription of the sermon]

For the word. Amen. Those who are watching wherever you are. God bless you. We know that the Lord will speak to you because he's faithful in Jesus' name. Go with me, please, to the book of Joshua chapter 1, verse 8. I want to speak to you this morning on what I believe is the most, the most important spiritual discipline and in believer can engage in. I want to speak to you on what I believe is the most important key to your spiritual growth, your emotional health, the most important key to your success in fulfilling God's purpose for your life.

This is something you cannot afford not to do and still expect to prosper and be successful in doing the will of God. Amen. And let me just say this, let's not forget. I know there are many of you who are impacted right now by what's happening with the government. And so at the end of this service, we want to pray for you and in lieu of the regular offerings that we take for, invest beyond, we're going to ask people as God moves their heart to give to us benevolence so that we can increase the amount of benevolence that we have, so that we can be in a better position to respond to members who have needs, okay? So instead of receiving the investment on offering today, we're going to receive an offering for benevolence so that we can respond. As if our members need help, we can do something to be of help, okay? Amen. But thank God, we serve a God who will provide. And I'm also encouraging all of you as members, to just be a little bit more sensitive to one another. And if you become aware that a brother or sister has a need, if you're able to meet that need, let the Lord use you. If it's more than you can do, communicate that to us, assuming that you believe it's going to be okay with them for us to know, communicate so that we can see how we might be able to be helpful as well, okay? But let's pray and be sensitive to one another during this time in Jesus' name. All right? But thank God for John, for Joshua chapter 1 verse 8. Amen? Let's read it together. The book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success.

This is God speaking to Joshua after Moses had died. The responsibility for not leaving Israel had fallen on the shoulders of Joshua. Joshua had been a disciple of Moses and armor bearer serving Moses for years now. Moses is gone and God has replaced Moses with Joshua and Joshua has this huge responsibility. That's God's plan and God's purpose for Joshua. That's part of Joshua's divine destiny. According to the perfect plan of God for him, it was his job to be used by God to lead Israel into the Promised Land. That man, he would have to face the king of night, he would have to deal with Jericho. He would have to overcome the resistance. It was a huge responsibility and God speaks to Joshua and what does God say to Joshua meditate?

Meditate. I believe that this is the most important and critical spiritual discipline and in believer can engage in if he expects to fulfill and to be successful in carrying out his divine assignment in life. You and I cannot succeed in fulfilling the purpose of God for our lives or the assignment that God has given us. We cannot, Joshua, have good success in executing that assignment. If we do not embrace and practice this discipline called meditation, say meditation.

Now most believers hardly read the word but even fewer take the time to truly meditate in scripture and reading the word is good but reading the word and meditating on the word are two different things. You will not fulfill your purpose and destiny if all you do is read the word and we will talk about it a little bit more but it is clear from this passage that meditation has a major priority for the believer and when Joshua was faced with what leadership responsibilities that had not fallen upon his shoulders were God spoke to him and yeah what he was about to do was to take his people forward he was about to engage in spiritual I mean warfare with very powerful enemies and yet when God spoke to him God didn't talk to him about military strategy.

God didn't say now you're going to be facing some real, real tough and difficult challenges that warfare you're about to engage in those people are well armed so let's talk about military strategy. That wasn't what God spoke to him about. Let's talk about training how you need to master the use of the sword and make sure you begin training the folks that was not what God prioritized instead God said to Joshua Joshua here's this huge assignment I've given to you and this is what I want to tell you in fact I want to command you to do this because if you don't do this you will not prosper and you will not succeed in this assignment you what do I do Lord this is what you got to do Joshua and I want you to hear God speaking to you I'm hearing God speaking to me and I hope you hear God speaking to you every one of you who is part of this church by now she knows you have a purpose but now you should know that you have a destiny you you ought to know you're not just here that God actually has a plan for your life and that is that plan that you should be desiring to fulfill I hear me and so you need to hear that to fulfill that plan and that purpose you need to give priority to meditating on the word of God says meditation must be my priority as a believer now why does God place such emphasis on meditation there's several reasons why this is the case God I believe actually ranks meditation above prayer as we could as we usually understand prayer above worship because God didn't say that Joshua this is the one thing you must do pray and keep praying nor did he say this the one thing you must do is worship and keep worshiping now we know prayer is high on God's priority list we know worshiping is high but God says Joshua meditate so so why why why is that the case well here's one reason why God says meditate and not pray because meditation is in fact prayer I hear me meditation is in fact prayer when you're meditating you are engaging in one of the highest forms of prayer you follow me and meditation is in fact an act of worship when you sit in there and you're meditating on God and on God's word you are actually engaging in one of the highest forms of worship so one of the reason meditation is ranked higher in my mind among the first among equals is that in fact meditation is prayer and in fact meditation is worship and meditation is the fuel that will set every other type of prayer on fire you didn't hear me meditation is the fuel that sets worship on fire meditation is the fuel that sets prayer on fire if if you simply praying without meditation you're praying with our revelation and when you're praying with our revelation it's just vain repetition let me talk to you here when you are praying without meditation you are praying without revelation and if you're praying without revelation then your words are simply vain repetition and man when you're worshiping with our revelation your worship is empty the simplest saying words oh God I praise you God I worship you God you but you don't have a revelation you said God is good but no revelation of his goodness you said God is powerful but there's no revelation of power then what are you doing you're just offering words and so revelation of meditation again I ranked the first among equals because revelation meditation is in fact prayer revelation is in fact worship and revelation is essential to empower other types of prayer and other types of worship all right so again one of the reasons why I must prioritize meditation and you must prioritize meditation Hallelujah in the book of Isaiah chapter six there's an illustration of that Isaiah says in verse one in the year that King Uzair died you're finished it I did what I saw revelation meditation I saw the Lord and I saw his glory I got a revelation of how glorious he was meditation revelation of glory and it filled the temple and then he had a revelation meditation of angels self him and cherubim and they were singing holy holy holy and those people those angels that were saying holy holy holy they were responding to what they were seeing so they too had a revelation of the glory of God and their prayer and their worship have been I've been fueled by that and so now when they say holy it's not just words it's it's a response well you're not hearing me man it's a response to what they have seen of God it's a response to what they have heard of God and so true worship true intercession true prayer flows out of revelation which comes through meditation I hear me so you can begin to understand why why God says to Joshua you I'm giving you this huge responsibility that's part of your death sentence that's your purpose but man before you even start to execute it you need to make this commitment that you're gonna do what you're talking you're gonna do what what are you gonna do well he says you're gonna meditate and he says you're gonna meditate in the word day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written there in for then you will have you will make your way prosperous and you will have good success so you will meditate in the day and night that's the command you shall which means for the believer who wants to do God's will meditation is not optional you shall do it not you can do it you might consider doing it if you have some time to do it no no if you jump over meditation you will not experience good success in doing the will and fulfilling your purpose I cannot expect to fulfill my purpose as a pastor or as a bishop if I do not obey this instruction cure me in fact let's let's go backwards because I think we can see it what the desire of God for Joshua and Joshua's own desire I'm sure was to do what prosper and succeed in executing the will of God and fulfilling God's purpose for him it's not your desire okay I want you to raise your hand if you not just satisfy or going through life hopefully getting a very good job making a lot of money living in a nice home and may you have all of those things plus some but I hope your your understanding of eternal things your understanding of the temporary and fleeting nature of this world is such that you are not going to live your life just for this world come on guys let me look look what's happening right now the government makes a decision and the job and the income and all of these things like this we we cannot put our hope in material things the Bible says mock and rust can't corrupt thieves will break in and steal Jesus said what will it profit you if you gain the whole world and at the end of the day because one thing is what certain all of us will leave everything says the called material behind nobody is taking any of those things with them the only things that go with you are the things you have given away not the things you held on to do you understand that how do I think sometimes God allows some certain things to happen just to remind us of what is really important are you hearing me so since we are too wise to live our lives just for this world we've got to be concerned far more about our eternal purpose and our destiny as it relates to eternity and the kingdom of God amen and if that is where you are then this is what you need to be hearing thou shalt say thou shalt say I shall meditate in God's word day and night now why because for me just exceed in doing God's will I've got to observe that means I got to know what's in the word and then I need to practice it because it's not the hero of the word that is blessed it's the toa you cannot fulfill your purpose and a your assignment if you're not going to practice what God has said you're not going to do what God has written in his word so if I want to be successful then I have to be obedient obedient carrying out the things that he has written okay that means believing what he said about the new testament acting on the new covenant obeying by believing and doing as the word instructs us that is essential right for us but take it to the next level what will it take for you to observe and practice the word meditation in other words the goal is to do and fulfill my purpose to fulfill my purpose I need to do the word but I cannot do the word in my own strength I need power and grace to do the word I receive that power and grace through meditation so meditating God's word is what empowers you to actually walk in it practice it meditating God's word is what transforms you into a doer and here've been guys this is why many of us are struggling with sin and we're living defeated lives even though we hear the word every Sunday or you even read the word regularly because we are failing to meditate you cannot meditate in God's word every day and not be transformed it is impossible so if you've been in charge for one year two years five years ten years and there's no change taking place you're still struggling with sin you're still living and going out to the flesh you're still fornicating committing the drugs or cussing lying walk here is the reason in black and white you really don't need to engage in long constant sessions seriously what you need is to take the word and the revelation that is in that word and for us the revelation of the new covenant and meditate in it and meditating in that word will literally transform you from the inside out and you will find yourself change in the way you think your emotions will change and when your thoughts change and your emotions change your behavior changes so so I'm convinced pastors one of the things we got to do more of is teach people how to meditate we've been teaching them the Bible giving them knowledge knowledge is good for the intellect it enters the head and that's where it stays and if the word you hear when it goes to the head and stays there it will not change you it you may become full of knowledge and puffed up but it will not change you the word doesn't change you if it enters your head and stays there for the word of God to produce the transformation in you that will cause you to observe that word and therefore bear fruit success it has to move from your head to your heart when it gets into your heart then it changes the way you think it changes the way you feel and when you when your thoughts and your feelings change behavior follows as a man think as a your behavior is a reflection of the thoughts and the emotions that you have buried on the inside of you if you can change those thoughts and change those those thoughts will change your emotions your behavior will follow but when we try to change behavior without dealing with thoughts and therefore the emotions that cause us to do what we got no business to you don't need more knowledge now knowledge is good but if all you want is knowledge you don't need more knowledge knowledge is important because they got to get into your head first before you can get into your heart but it has to go beyond your head it has to get into your heart say to your neighbor God's word has to go beyond your head into your heart where it can change your thinking your will your emotions and your behavior the word have our head in my heart that I might not sin against me what will cause you not to sin it is the presence of the word that you have hidden your heart I can't put it in your heart God himself doesn't put it in your heart God's gifts to you and he says now you take it and put in your heart God gets to farm a seed and he says now take the seed and plant it if you plant the seed the seed is going to grow and it's going to produce fruit but if all you do is keep the seed on the table and look at the seed and hold the seed and put it down and talk about the seed but you never put the seed into the soil the seed will keep the life it will never produce the fruit likewise if all you do is here and get knowledge but you do not take the necessary step to move that information from your head into your heart you will never experience the fruits or the transformation that the word can produce in your life your fear can give way to faith your love for sin can give way to a love for God your anger can change the kindness are you hear me and it can all happen and it will happen but only if you take the word that is in your head and put it in your heart so your listening to the word right now is entering your head so you read your Bible today if you just read it it enters your head now you must make the decision you're going to take that information that has entered your head and you're going to put it in your heart and the process for moving it from your head to your heart is called Meditation this book Joshua this word shall not depart from your mouth but you shall say I shall I shall I shall meditate how long day and night another as meditation must become a way of life for the man who wants to consistently walk in God's will and fulfill God's purpose meditation cannot be something you do not want them it must become a habit just like you eat habitually are you hear me you must meditate on the word let me use this metaphor if you just read the word it's like taking food and putting it in your mouth but you don't chew it you don't swallow it and you don't digest it will that help you you will get none of the nutrition that is in the food designed to strengthen you you got your chew it meditation is the process that God has designed by which we chew the word and digest the word so that we can extract all of the nutrition spiritually that is in that word that our spirit needs to prosper so you need faith you want your faith to be strengthened come on feed it by digesting the word you want to walk in holiness more take the work concerning holiness take the work concerning Jesus as your holiness take the work concerning what Christ has accomplished on the cross take the work concerning who you are now in Christ you are saved to a holy one take that word and meditate chew on it swallow it let it enter your heart and it will change your behavior it will do what it will change your behavior are you prepared to eat some of this up I don't meditate yes you do every single one of us here knows how to and all of us at least have our master's degree in it some of you got PhDs he said when you talk my bishop I'm talking about your highly developed ability to worry oh yeah I'm talking about what your highly developed and if you know how to worry you know how to meditate you know how to take a thought you know how to take an experience you know how to take something somebody said or something somebody did that you didn't like that you didn't appreciate you know how to take it and you know how to chew on it day and night I tell you can't sleep even on your bed David's time meditate on the word in the night watching so what David was on his bed he was meditating on the word when you are on your bed you're meditating on what that person said what that person did what they shouldn't have done how you're going to deal with them the next time you see it you are not going to take that nonsense from him then body it and man you meditate upon until you leave the church the church you love the church you love the bishop you love the pastor you love everything you love one person does something to you and you grab it you say I'm going to chew it and you chew it and you chew it and then you swallow it you digest it and it changes you all the sudden you no longer like the church I met you said that the person next to you you have your PhD in meditation it's called worrying for you absolutely and you do that with a lot of things unfortunately we meditate but we meditate on the wrong things but those things you meditate on it's going to change you I don't meditate on that I'm fine it's going to change you it's going to change the way you think it's going to change the way you feel and all of a sudden people who you like you don't want to deal with them anymore and then you become miserable and seriously I mean this is a real problem right because what you meditate on is going to impact you and so you got to choose what you're going to meditate on when you when you worry you're simply meditating on the devil's lies and when you meditate on the devil's lies that form of meditation produces fear doubts makes you and then can lead to discouragement and even depression and here you are a Christian you have no joy but joy is inside of you but what did you do you meditate on the lies of the devil is so you are depriving yourself of the experience of the joy that you already have in you I met so hear me understand this your brain is like a thermostat you know what a thermostat is amen you come into a room if it's too cold and you have a good work in thermostat you don't you don't do much you just go to the thermostat and you say right now it's too cold so I'm going to move it from 60 to west what's comfortable 72 but on 72 and the thermostat communicates to the the heater or whatever they call it and that thing begins to produce heat and before you know it the environment you're in the temperature has changed from colds 50 to 72 comfortable you change your thermostat and the entire environment and the temperature changed are you hear me your brain or your mind is like that and you have to power to decide where you going to set your mind so if you are worrying is because the brain the thermostat is set on worry the brain is set on the kinds of things that produce worry you can stay there and live there if that's what you choose or you can decide no I want to do something with my thermostat I want to change it from worry to fate I want to change it from worry to trust I want to change it from worry to peace I want to set my thermostat on peace amen so if you decide right now my thermostat is set on worry I don't like that I'm not comfortable here and I'm not going to set it on peace you know what the thermostat is how do you set it Paul said in Romans 12 be renewed in your mind thermostat then Paul says in Romans chapter 8 the mind set on the spirit is life and peace the mind set on the flesh is dead so what do you do it has to do with the mind and so now you decide I'm going to take my brain my thermostat and I am going to find what God has to say about this situation that will comfort and encourage me and move me from worry to peace I'm going to find what God has to say in this word and this is what I'm going to set my mind on he who sets his mind on the spirit walks after the spirit experiences life and peace he who sets his mind on the flesh experiences this so I am as an actor my will I want to take this brain which is my thermostat and I want to set it on God set it on God's promises set it on grace set it on right Christ has done set it on who he says I am this is what I'm going to do I'm going to set it on peace and when you do that and he says not in day right so you set it and that's becomes what you focus on eventually you will move from worry to peace your circumstances may not change immediately but something will change in you and that change that will take place in you is what you need to be victorious and successful all right because I want you to do something with this I love it when you clap you encourage me but I want you to do something with this I want you to make a decision you're going to take your brain which is your thermostat and you're going to choose to set it on peace set it on life set it on the promises of God set it on the goodness of God set it on the faithfulness of God I'm going to find the scriptures that reveal who Jesus is and what Jesus has done and who I am in Jesus and I as an actor my will you have to do this I'm going to set my mind on those things you said Bishop give me some more scripture ah Philippians it's a Philippines four four one eight what's the ever things are what's ever things are can you go there there we go some oh I love you thank God for the people you just made my job easy let's go whatever things are true whatever things are whatever things are whatever things are what's about things are lovely what's about things are good report if there's an virtue if there's anything praise worthy so what is that scripture saying you decide what you are going to set your mind to and here are the types of things that you're supposed to set your mind to and if you read the full context when you do this the Bible says the peace that passes all understanding will keep your mind will keep your heart in Christ Jesus but you now must make the decision that you are going to do what take the thermostat in my brain is a thermostat and the way I set the thermostat is through meditation on these things let me say it another way the only things that you should set your mind on are things that will glorify God and things for which you can give God thanks that's what it is in short five things for which you can glorify God set your mind there five things for which you can give God thanks set your mind there and if the temperature in your life ever moves from peace and begins to move towards worry or anxiety you know you need to pause and reset your mind say this book of the law say the word of God and for us in the new covenant say the word of grace shall not depart from our eyes or from our mouths but we will do what meditate on it take continuously because if I do so say that I will be making my way prosperous and I will be making my way successful so let's let's see if we can get a bit more practical I'm going to set my mind on the word of God meditation is really about focusing your attention on a particular object a particular thought a particular experience you decide I'm going to focus my mind on this and when it comes to biblical meditation you're going to focus your mind on God you're going to focus your mind on Jesus you're gonna focus your mind on grace you're gonna focus your mind on love you're gonna focus your mind on the presence and minutes of the Holy Spirit you're gonna focus your mind and quote unquote you're gonna worry about it you know what I mean You're going to do everything you do when you're worrying. But this time you're going to be focusing on God, on Jesus, on the Holy Spirit, on grace, on the promises of God, on the things already done. You're going to do that focus. You're going to give your attention to it. And here is the ultimate purpose. The reason you're doing this is you want to exchange your thoughts for God's. That is the aim. So you keep meditating focusing on a particular verse, or a particular thought, or particular idea, or particular characteristic of God and of Jesus, for which you can give God thanks. You keep focusing your thoughts on that because here's your goal to exchange your thoughts for God's. And the more you focus, the longer you focus, the greater the transformation. Think of meditation like a sponge. If you take this sponge and you just put it in the water and take it out, the outside may be wet, but the inside still dry. But if you put the sponge there and you keep the sponge there and you soak it, the entire sponge becomes wet. So you don't want to just touch the word and come and you want to put your mind there and keep it there until your mind is soaked with God's thoughts, thereby exchanging yours for His. Or maybe a similar illustration. When you want to drink tea and you got the tea bag, if you just dip the tea and hold it back, not much happens for the water. But if you want the water to become tea and you want it to be strong tea, you put the back in the water and you keep it there until the tea has really gotten into the water. And now when you drink the water, you don't taste water, you taste tea. So you want to take the word of God and you want to dip your mind inside the word and keep your mind in the word long enough for the word to permeate your mind to the point that you now start talking like God, thinking like God, acting like God. Then you know the word has truly had is effect in your life. All right, so tell the person next to you, stop dipping and start soaking, stop skimming and start meditating and God's word. Amen. Now, when you leave here, you have a choice. If you just chose to listen and dip by tonight, you would have probably forgotten most of what I said. And one year from now, you wouldn't have changed. But if you take this word which you heard and you choose to set your mind on the truth, you heard, to focus your mind on what you heard, to run it over and over in your mind, to you will notice a transformation in your prayer life. Yeah. You can stop going from one person to the other person seeking prayer for deliverance. You can stop it. You can stop asking, what is your strategy, what is the key, what is the secret? I already told you the secret. This is it all. So what you got to do, if you really, really understand, you've got to make it what a priority, a priority. That means you've got to find time to focus your thoughts on the Word of God. Attempt to it. To look at it. Hear it, my son. Attempt to my words. Look at it. Incline your ears to my sayings. Hear it. My son, I tell you my words. Incline. Don't let it depart from your eyes. Keep it where? Don't let it depart from your eyes. Really means don't let it depart from your imagination. Hear me? Take it. Read it. Hear it. Speak it. And then don't let it depart from your imagination. Take the Word that you've read and allow the Holy Spirit to help you to see it in your imagination. Whatever the truth is, if the truth is that you're not a kind person, you're quick on getting angry. Somebody is just criticized as you're small, you're angry. That's your default. Now you know that's not Christ's light. And you want to change that. You want to experience change in your thinking, in your feelings, in your actions. Take the Word of God that has to do with kindness. Put that Word in your heart. Look at it. Read it. Repeat it. Review it. Rehears it. Everyday. Return to it on Monday. To say, return to it. Read it. Review it. Rehears it. And then see yourself being kind. Imagination. I don't know who it is that gets on your nerve. But see that person who gets on your nerve coming again and doings the same thing that gets on your nerve. But this time see yourself being kind. You're exchanging your thoughts, right? See yourself. The next time she comes, instead of planning how you're going to. You want to exchange your thoughts for God, right? So now that you read it, you review it, you rehearse it, you declare it. Now see yourself in your mind and some of you got good imaginations. You're just imagining the wrong things. Because you know how to imagine how you would give it to her. Exchange that for God's response. And literally imagine how nice you're going to be. How you're not going to let her bother you. Because after all you know who you are. And how you will let her just roll off of you like water on dust back. And how you're going to repay her unkindness with your kindness. See yourself in that situation. And stay there. And then you say, Holy Spirit, that's why I am. That's what I choose to be. Thank you for the ability to respond as Christ. If you do that, not just once, but consistently, you will be surprised. How the next time the very same person will come to you. And do the same thing. And that old man will want to show up. But the new man will prevail. Because your mind has been renewed through meditating on God's work. Say hallelujah. Say hallelujah. So even now right now I get I know a number of you are challenged financially. Because of what's happening and it's scary in the natural. But this is a good time to get into the word. And just meditate on the Father's love. The Father's faithfulness. Seek you first the kingdom of God and the things will be added. I will never lead you. No. You got a choice to spend the rest of the days worrying about how you're going to pay the bill tomorrow. Or you can say no. I'm going to change the thermostat. I'm going to put the thermostat on peace. I'm going to put it on trust. I'm going to put it on rest. I'm going to put it on faith because worrying is not going to change anything anyway. That's what I'm going to do. You take the scriptures and you do that. And you will be amazed how that type of praying will produce Christ a change in you. And it has the power to change your circumstances. Because not only the Joshua change, Joshua ended up defeating the kid and nights. Say hallelujah to God be the glory. Let's stand to our feet. All right. Raise your hands to heaven. Now I want you to tell Jesus. Thank you for his word. Thank you for the power of his word. Thank you for the privilege of being able to change the thermostat and change the temperature on the inside of you spiritually. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now I want you to take maybe one promise, one verse or one thing you know about God, for which you can give thanks for right now. And I want you to focus your thoughts. Focus your mind on that aspect of God. If you need God to be a father right now, focus on that. You provide a shepherd. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for peace. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for protection. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for patience. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for provision. Take one truth that you know about God. Focus on that. And give God some praise. And if you can now begin to envision that, you can use your words, your mouth, your imagination, but to begin to see yourself where God is being your father. See yourself where God is providing for you. Go ahead and do that. Yes, Lord. Amen. Whatever the challenges of this healing, see yourself being healed by God. You can begin to say every day in every way I'm getting healthy and healthy because God is my human. Every day, every way I'm doing better and better because God is my provider. See it. I'm going to rest in this storm because the father is watching over me. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Jesus. In the name of Jesus, Hallelujah. Amen. What you just did, if you follow my instructions, was meditate. Now, the more sustained is your focus is the more impact what you're meditating on the apple. Every time you hear a sermon on Sunday like you do, Aksa, what is it that was said that God wants me to know? What is it that God wants me to believe? What did I hear that needs to be replaced by all thoughts? Capture that. It can be one, it can be two, it can be three things, but capture it. And then make a decision, you're going to meditate on that. Not just for a few minutes, but you're going to meditate upon it today. You're going to meditate upon it tomorrow. You meditate upon it all week and all night if necessary. So that that truth gets planted in your heart so you can produce the fruit that it has the power to produce. When you read a scripture, it's not the need, it's not for you to necessarily read a lot. What you need to do is to meditate a lot. So you may read one verse or you may read several verses, but then what are the truths in this thing? What is here about God that I just learned? What is here about his character that I just saw? What is here that I'm supposed to believe you captured that? And when you can't create a picture of it, and every day, even as you're driving at work, keep bringing it back to your mind and seeing it again and again, again, until your thoughts have been exchanged for it. I guarantee you, if you receive the word in this manner, it will change you in Jesus' name. Look at me. The Bible says, received with mickness, the ingratid word, but it says, as new born beings, how does a baby receive the baby sucks and sucks and sucks? That's how that baby eats. Take the word of God and suck on it. And keep sucking. And the more you suck on it, the sweeter it will become. I guarantee you. I talk from experience. The more you suck on the word, the sweeter it will become. I'll tell you, get to the point where the baby says, oh, how I love your word. Your appetite for the word will increase significantly the more you suck on it. Turn to your university, start sucking. In Jesus' name.

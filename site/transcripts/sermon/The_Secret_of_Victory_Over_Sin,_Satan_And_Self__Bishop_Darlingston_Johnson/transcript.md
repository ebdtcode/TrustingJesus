Father, we thank you now for the time you've given us to use this word to minister to your people and to be transformed. In Jesus' name, say today, the word of God will enter my mind and my heart and will transform my life. Amen? Go ahead, please, and just go on the screen and put the scripture, Romans chapter 6, and let's just begin in verse 1. But before we read it, I do want to make a comment here. We've just preached several messages out of Romans chapter 5. And today, we're going to be looking at Romans 6. Of course, this is one letter, and there is a continuity. So, Romans 6 is definitely connected to Romans 5. But in Romans 5, we present it to you what we call the three treasures, the three treasures of salvation. Say the three treasures of salvation. Can anyone tell me what those three treasures are? Peace with God. Amen? Secondly? Secondly what? Huh? Well, hope is one, but before hope was grace. Amen? And the third is hope. Amen? Powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful. That was to wake you up. Life transforming truths, but they will do you absolutely no good if you've already forgotten them. That's why Jesus talks about when he said when the word is preached, immediately the enemy comes to steal it, so that it doesn't bear fruit. So it becomes your responsibility not to let the enemy steal the truth. And the way you do that is by listening over and over, you got to write it down, the mean truths, write it down. Whatever, whatever you do to retain something, and we're all different, but whatever you know helps you to retain what you hear, you need to be done it with the word. Okay? Because while we're providing our so fundamental to your spiritual growth, that if you don't have a true revelation of what it means to have peace with God to be standing in the grace of God and to have this hope of the glory of God as the anchor for your mind, will and emotions. You have missed your ABCs. And if you can't, if you don't know ABC, you'll never be able to read. Okay? You've missed your one, two, one plus two, two plus three. You've missed the basic math. And if you don't know how to add, you're not going to know how to multiply, divide. You're not going to do algebra. You're not going to do anything. You understand that just some things that are so critical to your spiritual growth that you have to prioritize. Thank God, everything we said is recorded. Go back and listen to the series over and over and over again until you can preach it better than I did. In Jesus' name. So now those were very wonderful truths, but if you are like most Christians, you've likely experienced this cycle. You've sinned. You feel guilty. You repent. You make up your mind. You're really going to try hard not to do that again. And then you sin again. And you feel guilty. And you repent. And you make up your mind. You're going to try hard again and it's a cycle. And you find yourself being frustrated. And it feels like the battle you're in, you can never win. Now, what if I told you that the secret to victory, who was sin, who was Satan, who was self, over your physical enemies, real or imagined? Because some of us got some imagined ones. What if I told you whether they were real or imagined? What if I told you the secret to victory isn't about you mustering more willpower? What if I said to you, the Christian life is less about striving, and more about letting and not letting. It's less about striving with human effort and determination, willpower, and it's more about letting and not letting. And I'll talk to you a little bit more about what I'm talking about there. What if the battle over sin, Satan, self, and your physical enemies once again, real and imagined was already won for you by Jesus or by you through Jesus. It doesn't matter how you say it, it's the same thing. That the battle over sin, the victory, has already been won over sin, over Satan, over self, over those physical enemies. By Christ! I'm going to preach my own self-happy if you don't get me. By Christ, for me, welcome back back to the money, good to see you. Amen? By Christ, for you or by you through Christ. It matters not how you say it's the same thing. Would you believe me? You see the secret to walking in victory is not just right, but to let say let. Let that victory work itself out in your life. That victory that Christ has won for you, or that you have won through your union with Christ, the secret is to let that work out in your life. There's a difference between striving and trying to force something to happen and letting it happen. Now, your will is involved in letting something happen. So, at the end of the day, you got to exercise your will. But there's a difference between forcing something and letting something. If you came to my house and I didn't invite you, and you came with bad intentions and you rang my bell, you would have to force yourself to get into my house because I am going to resist you. And only if you are strong enough and powerful enough to get through my door or to get through me, will you get into my house? And by the way, I am a five-star black belt karate. So, don't mess with me now. I'll knock you out. I'm joking. Don't take that for a truth. But you can imagine that scenario. Versus, I invited you in. I invited you to my house, you rang the bell. I was simply opening the door and let you in. There's a huge difference between having to force your way into something and simply letting something happen. I still have to open the door to let you in. But there's a huge difference between having to force your way in and coming through the door once I opened it. The victory, the Christian life, is not about spreading to win victory, over sin, Satan, self, etc. But it's about letting the victory, that Christ has already won for us, worked itself out in our lives. Are you still here? And so, there's a secret for making that happen. And it's this secret that Paul reveals to us in Romans chapter 6. And we're going to spend some time looking at it today, because we struggle yet, even though Christ has done all that he has done. And the reason we continue to find ourselves not walking in victory, but in a cycle of defeat, is because of ignorance or unbelief. That's the reason we continue to sin, continue to have to mean it over us, or Satan continues to exercise power in our lives, and we're continuing to feel defeated. It's not because your victory is not already accomplished, it's because either of ignorance, you don't know certain things you should know, or even after it has been spoken to you, you choose not to believe it. See, this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith, our believing. What is the victory that overcomes the world? Our believing. So in Romans chapter 6, Paul reveals what I call the secret of victory over these three things. And that secret is rooted and grounded in the truth, concerning our identification with Christ, and our union with Christ. So with that in mind, let us go ahead and read Romans chapter 6 and we're going to read, probably all the way to verse 14. Let's stand because I want you to be a lurch while we read. And I want you to not just read this, but be listening. Pay attention to the words being used, because we'll be commenting on them in the rest of this message. Let's go. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that graces me about? Certainly not. How shall we who died to sin? We who did what? Die to sin. Live any longer in it. Next verse. Or do you not know, say no, that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus, were baptized into his death. Therefore, we say we were buried with him through baptism into death that just as Christ was raised from the dead, by the just as Christ was raised, say just as. Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the power of the Father, even so we also should now walk in newness. Now walking isn't hard. This is so we can walk. We can walk. He did all of that so we can be able to walk. Walking is natural. Walking is not a struggle. Now you tell me run, I might struggle, but I can walk without much effort, other than deciding to walk. So we also should walk in new form if we have been in the likeness of his resurrection. Amen. Verse 7. Knowing, say knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be what, done away with that. What is God's purpose that we should no longer be why? So God has done something so that sin no longer has dominion over us. God has done something so that we should no longer be slaves. God has done something so we should be able to simply walk in victory over sin, not having to fight for it. For he who has, has been. All right. Now if we die, not where it means since. Now since this is a fact, say now, since we die with Christ, we believe that we also live, because he lives, we live. Knowing that Christ haven't been raised from the dead, there's no more death. Death no longer has dominion over who? Therefore, verse 10, for the death that he died, he died to sin once for all, but the light that he lives, he lives to God. Now watch what he's going to say next as a result of this. Christ died to sin. Oh, you went there too quickly by anyway. Christ died to sin. Go back to verse 10. He died to sin. How many times? How many times? Once for all time. But the light that now he lives, see that's what? Now why? What should you be your response? Likewise, you also reckon yourself to be what? Dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ died to sin. Likewise, you also reckon yourself what? But alive to reckon yourself to sin, but alive to God. In Christ Jesus, our Lord raise your head and say thank you Jesus. Next verse, let's go on. Therefore, do not let sin, say let sin, let it. Let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lust. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as being and your members as present yourself to God as people who are alive, present yourself to him as people who are alive to God. And your members as instruments of righteousness to God, verse 14, for sin shall now have dominion over you, authority over you, it cannot dominate you. For now because of what you have done, but because of what God has done by grace, sin has lost its dominion of power over you. So if you are still struggling with sin, it's because of ignorance of unbelief. And so what we wanted you today is to explain this, use a few illustrations to help you so that you will no longer be ignorant if you are, or you will believe if you have not been believing. Because you see you can read all of that and then still approach your victory over sin as though Christ has done nothing about it, that the battle now is still yours. Please receive it. So what are we going to do? We're going to uncover how this truth is the key to experiencing real freedom from birth. What is this truth that I'm talking about? It's the truth of our identification and union with Christ. One motivated God to bring the established peace to give us grace, to give us hope. What motivated him is the love of God. The Bible talks about that in Romans 5. It is the love of God. God commanded his love for us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. So it is God's love that caused him to do whatever he did so that there would be peace and there would be grace and there would be hope in your life. So thank God for loving us so much. Listen, never take that for granted because just imagine if God was evil. Just imagine if God was wicked. Just imagine if God was a slave master. Can you imagine what your life would be like? Thank God he is none of that. But God is love. And we who are his children, we are the objects of his love. Let me tell you something else. God loves everybody. But God's children are his favorites. God favors you over the unbeliever. And then, I mean, your parent, your man, you're supposed to love everybody's children and be good to everybody. Yeah, but you favor your own. And you will be wrong not to favor your own. You'll be wrong to say, you know what? I love other children just as much. No, you're supposed to love your children more. You're supposed to favor your children more. Doesn't mean you can't love other kids and help them. But as a father, as a mother, you're supposed to have a special love for your children. And if you don't, something's wrong with you, okay? So God loves the whole world. But the truth is God favors us. Those of us who are in Christ. Those of us who are believing and trusting in Jesus and Jesus the Savior, Lord, God favors us because we are his kids. In a way that the world is not. Come and raise your heads and thank you, Lord. For loving me and favoring me. So it is this love of God that has motivated God to do everything he has done. But God has followed a particular process. He has to do it in a certain way to accomplish it. Amen? He has to do that. You see because the problem of the sinner is not that he's bad. The problem of the sinner is that he's dead. And the only thing that can help a dead man is life. A dead man has no other, there is absolutely nothing you can do for a dead man that will improve his situation. One bit you can do, what can you do for a dead man that will make his situation better? You cannot do anything to help him. The only thing you can do for a dead man that will make a difference is to give him life. You hear me? So the problem that we had was a problem that produced death and the only thing that could change our circumstances was for us to receive life. And God is the only one who can give life. And thank God the whole plan of salvation was designed to give us life. So now that you are in Christ, this is what you have. You have life. Jesus says, I have come that you may have what? What? That's what you needed. Nicodemus, you've got to be born again. Nicodemus, you need life. I have come so you may have life and have it more, more what? Abundantly. Now, we need to grasp this revelation about densification and union because the whole purpose for this doctrine of identification, union with Christ, is because it is the means by which God gives to dead people life. And that light is what transforms them. It is that light that gives them dominion over sin. It's that light that gives them dominion over Satan. It's that light that gives them dominion over self. It's that light that gives them dominion over enemies. The life that they lack because of sin is what God has given us for God to do that. He implemented this plan that theologians refer to as identification with Christ or union with Christ. Amen? So hear me. The approach that many of us have in terms of living the Christian life, in terms of sanctification. The approach is to come to God with the attitude or to approach the Christian life with the attitude. Lord, you have saved me in terms of, you know, you've forgiven my sins and by the grace of God I'm going to heaven. Now, I'm going to do my part by dying to sin. How many of you heard this? Died to sin. You got to die to sin. You heard that before? Raise your hand. Have you heard that before? Yeah. How many of you have been trying to die to sin every day? No, I mean, you're telling me the truth. Not more. You should be lifting your hands. Amen. You've been trying to die to sin. You've got to die to sin. You've got to die to sin. You've got to die to sin. How many of you know that the Bible never commands you to die to sin? Why doesn't the Bible say you'll believe a die to sin? The answer is because you just read. You are dead to sin. Then you read. You are dead to sin. And you should present yourself to God as a lie from the dead. So if you are supposed to be presenting yourself as a lie, why? You know? To God. Why? The Bible doesn't say to the believer die to sin. The Bible says to the believer. You are dead to sin. And you are a lie to God. So one of the reasons for your failure is you're trying to die to something you're dead to. Which means you're ignorant or you're not believing. And that opens the door for the enemy. You are not able to walk in the power of what God has done because you're either ignorant or you don't believe it. You're preaching good. The scripture says you're dead to sin. You say I've got to die to sin. That means you're challenging God's word. You refuse to believe God's word. You think you know more. And you think you're being humble. Now the truth is, many of you believe that because we preach a soul to you that. Now you ought to read the Bible for yourself. But since you don't read it much for yourself, of course you depend upon preachers. So you better hope you're listening to the truth because many preachers are not preaching the truth. But the truth is you are what? Yeah, believers are dead to sin. Believers are what? Alive to God. So dying, I've got to die. He said, but Bishop didn't say he died daily. But yeah, Paul said I died daily. He didn't say I died to sin daily. You're the one who said Paul said he had to die to sin daily. What was Paul talking about? Read the context. And you'll see Paul was not talking about sin. When Paul said I died daily, he was talking about all the persecutions, all the things he went through physically where he was exposed to death. Every day just about he was subject to something because he was so bold, so committed in doing God's work, he went through all kinds of things. He was arrested. He was beaten. They were chasing him from one place to the other. He had to constantly be hiding because every day his life was on the line. For what he believes. So Paul was talking about the persecution and the suffering and all that he had to go through physically for the sake of the gospel. So when he says I died daily, he was talking about those things on a daily basis. He had to die or he was facing death for the cause of Christ. But as regards to sin, the scriptures are very clear. You are what? Death to sin. And you're supposed to do what? Present yourself to God as those who are alive to God. Alive to righteousness. So when you continue to see yourself as a sinner trying to win victory over sin, you don't realize or you're not believing that the victory over sin has already been won. So you're getting ready to fight. Every day you're fighting for victory that Christ has already won for you. Or you have already won in Christ. Either way, you're already a victor. Raise your hands and say thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm still feeling the pull of sin. Well again, that's why we need to understand what happened when we were saved. So let me talk about identification. Identification is this doctrine or this truth that in the plan of salvation, God placed us in Christ. God joined us to Jesus and God made us one with Him. Identification is not just a legal transaction, it's not just a nice metaphor. It's not just a way to illustrate something, to help you understand it. Identification is real. Union with Christ is real. It's a spiritual reality. When the Bible says we are in Christ, this is not figuratively speaking. It is because you are actually vitally in Christ, actually vitally connected to Him. Christ is indeed your life. Are you hear me? You are unified to Him. And this is why we read in Romans 6.3.5. Romans 6.3.5 says that we were baptized into Christ Jesus. It says that Jesus, that we were buried with Jesus. It says that we were raised with Jesus. It says that we now have the life of Jesus. Ephesians 2 tells us we are seated with Jesus. All of those verses point to a reality. It's like me saying, Elder Morty is sitting in this chair. I'm not saying we should pretend he's sitting there. Imagine he's sitting there. Have it in our mind because of the power of positive thinking. If we think it long enough and we consider it long enough, it will become no. If I say he is sitting in that chair, it's because he is sitting there. If I say to you today, you are gathered at harvest. It's because you are gathered. This is so. So when the Bible says we died with Christ and we were buried with Christ and we were risen with Christ and we ascended with Christ. And we are seated with Christ. Those things are spiritual reality. All right? Say we are in Christ for real. Say we are in Christ for true. Say true true. We are in Christ. Now, that changes your story. You see, you are used to telling your story but are considering this part of your story. You tell your story only in terms of your physical experiences. That's for you, it's your story. But there's a story of your life that is revealed to you in the word that you must take into account as real when you're dealing with sin, you're dealing with Satan, you're dealing with self, you're dealing with the enemies. You must take this at real and pray from that reality. Speak from that reality. Act from that reality. Conduct yourself from that reality. I am in Christ joined to Him. Now, if you are in Christ and joined to Him, then everything Christ goes through or experiences you are going to experience with Him. Every victory He wins, you're going to win in Him. Every place He moves through, you're going to go there because you're in Him. Let me use an illustration. Here is a book, and I want to put this handkerchief inside the book. Where's the handkerchief? Where's the book? In my hand. Where's the handkerchief? In my hand. Where's the book? Where's the handkerchief? Forgive me. Where's the book? Where's the handkerchief? Where's the book? Where's the handkerchief? As long as the handkerchief is in this book, everywhere the book goes, the handkerchief goes. Are you hear me? And that is the reality. You are in Christ. God put you in Him. Now, you say, how God did that? Well, God can do anything God wants to do, and you don't have to understand. You don't even know how you're hitting you. Let's come on. God, well, your little peanut brain, do you think you are able to understand all that God is capable of doing? You have to be able to explain God's work to understand and believe what God has done. I don't know how God did this, but he performed some kind of surgery on Calvary. He did something and put you inside of Jesus and joined your spirit to His so that everything Jesus goes through, you actually go through. So that His story becomes your story. As long as this handkerchief is in this book, this story of this book will be the history of the handkerchief. Say hallelujah. So when Jesus went to the cross, because you were in Him, you also went to the cross. When Jesus died, you were in Him. What did Jesus die to? Sin. What did you die to? When they buried Jesus in the tomb, where were you? In Jesus in the tomb. So you were buried also with Him. What? You were in Him. And on Sunday morning when He resurrected, He had overcome sin. He had overcome Satan. He had overcome the old man. He had overcome the world. He had even overcome death. And when He overcame all of those things on Sunday, where were you? So what were you doing? Overcoming. You are doing what? Overcoming. When He faced principality and powers and defeated them, when He defeated Satan, where were you? What were you doing? So that the victory Jesus won over Satan and over sin and over self, the victory He won, the defeat of Satan was your victory. The defeat of Satan by Jesus was, in fact, your victory over Satan. Over sin. Do you understand? Now, you cannot believe that until you fundamentally believe you are in Him. If you don't believe you are in Him, then none of the things I said you can embrace. So at the very core of Christianity, at the very essence of your faith, is this understanding of God's plan of salvation? God is in Christ, and God has placed you in Christ, and joined you to Him. I said on Friday night, I said something about tea, and my sister here was so blessed by that. Yeah, she came to me and thanked me. I said, listen, when you have water, and you place a tea bag into the water, it is because you want the water to become like tea. Are you listening to me? And so you got water there and walked up, but when you put the tea bag in it, you call it now, tea because it ticks on the qualities of the tea. The reason God puts Christ in you and you in Christ is because God wants you to become like Jesus. And God accomplishes it by putting Christ in you. If you want to drink tea, what are you going to do? You're going to find tea and put it in the water so that the water becomes tea. God wants you to be like Jesus. What does God do? He takes Jesus, and put Jesus in you, and you in Jesus, and you become like Jesus. Hallelujah. So now the Bible says, we are an aroma. We are what? And a aroma of Christ. Why? Because it's in us, and we are in Him. When you understand this, then the reality that I shared earlier, the picture over sin is not about fighting, it's about letting. Letting what has already happened, happened in your experience. Let me just work out in your life. Letting what has already happened, happened by believing. In your experience, you keep struggling, you keep struggling, and you will continue to struggle until you embrace fully this revelation of your union and identification with Christ. That's Christianity. Christianity is not imitation, it's participation in the very life of Christ. Christianity is not imitation, it's participation in the life of the Son of God. Let me give you at least one or two more illustrations. This one is the relationship between a baby in the womb of her mother or his mother and the mother. A baby in the womb of her mother is a person, has its own existence. It's a person by the same time that baby is one with her mother for all practical purposes. That baby lives because the mother lives. And that baby is able to grow and develop and at some point become a fully functional adult because while in her mother's womb, she was joined to her mother. And everything she needed to live and grow was being supplied through her union with her mother. Thank God for the umbilical cord. That umbilical cord connects the baby to her mother. So that what the baby needs to live and grow is actually being supplied continually by the mother. You know that baby cannot breathe. Yet the baby needs oxygen. Oxygen, oxygen. The mother must have oxygen or it cannot live. And so what happens? Mother breathes for her baby. The oxygen, the mother needs that baby needs. The mother takes it in and then supplies it via the umbilical cord to the bloodstream of the baby so that the baby has oxygen. Literally, mother is breathing for the baby. And the mother can breathe for the baby because they are joined together. They are one. And then you know you got to breathe in. You need oxygen, but then you got to breathe out because you got to exhale and you got to get rid of the carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream of the baby, the baby dies because it's poisonous. So mother has to breathe in, inhale for the baby, in order to supply the oxygen that the baby needs, the breath of life, the spirit, whatever you want to call it, is there being breathed in the bloodstream of the baby? And then when the baby produces the waste, the carbon dioxide, other things, guess what? That waste gets back into the bloodstream of the mother. Goes to the lungs of the mother so the mother can exhale it. Goes to the kidneys of the mother so the mother can excrete it. So for nine months, that baby in the womb is totally completely dependent. It assesses all that baby is doing, is let mom breathe for her. Let mom inhale and let mom exhale. Let mom, and I'll just through the umbilical cord, I'll just let it happen. Are you hearing me? Are you hearing me? And as a result, our process of baby is able to grow, develop, and one day become a fully functional human being, a fully functional adult. But that union in the womb of mom was absolutely essential. Now, sometimes something goes wrong with that process. Something interferes with the baby's growth and development. Maybe something happens. And the doctors have the ability, skilled surgeons have the ability to open up a perform surgery. Go in, they call it open fetal surgery, and take the baby out of the mother's womb. And the baby now exists outside and perform a surgical procedure that may be required to save the baby's life. And then put the baby back into the womb and seal the womb. And that baby continues now, because the pregnancy continues and the baby continues to feed off and breathe of and receive from her mother whatever she needs until she is able to be born. Now, that's a picture of South Asia. That's the way it was supposed to be what human beings were created were supposed to be dependent upon God for everything God breathing for us, God exhaling for us. Are you hear me? We are individual, but yet we're so joined to him, we're one with him. But then sin entered. And we're sin entered the umbilical cord. That spiritual umbilical cord that connected us to God was cut. We now found ourselves living externally and the Bible says in that condition we were in fact dead to sin. Dead in sin, excuse me. We're dead in sin. We're dead to God. And we were descending into hell into eternal destruction. There was a need for emergency intervention. Someone needed to intervene in order to perform the necessary surgical procedures that will allow us not to eternally be destroyed by the lathe. And thank God, the only one who could oh my goodness. I said, thank God for the physicians who sometimes can perform surgery and save the physical life of a baby. But only God could intervene and bring life to us. And so what did God do? He did it. Through Jesus Christ on the cross, God performed spiritual surgery. He literally performed operation. He opened Jesus up. He restored the broken umbilical cord and he took us. And he put us right back inside of Jesus. And then he closed the wound and he sealed the wound with the Holy Spirit. But us in Jesus. And now if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. And now we are one with the Lord. And now listen to me. Jesus himself by the Spirit of God is breathing for you. You need to understand. You are alive because Jesus is healing. You are alive because Jesus is exhaling. And all you have to do is let him. Are you hear me? He is inhaling. He is exhaling. He is breathing in. He is breathing out. And as long as he is breathing in and breathing out. And you are letting him breathe in and breathe out. You will grow. You will mature. You will develop. You will be perfected. And one day you will be fully totally completely conformed to the image of Jesus. Say hallelujah. One more time. Say hallelujah. Let our eyes open. Let us see it. Now let me come back and reinforce what I just said. Sin disconnected us. We were living apart from him and we could not on our own greed. God did something on the cross. And he repaired the spiritual umbilical cord. Whatever the system was, I am using the umbilical cord he has to metaphor. But whatever the spiritual system that God has established that allowed the life of Christ to enter us and for us to actually live back Christ's life. Whatever the system that God needed to put in place that allowed Christ to literally be breathing for us spiritually so that he keeps us alive. God did that on the cross. Henceforth, you are like that baby in the womb of Jesus. You are living by the power of His life. Say this life that I live. I live by the power of that life which is His life in me. Say this life, the Christian life that I live. I live daily by the power of that life which is His life in me. Those are facts. Words cannot fully explain no illustration is perfect. But here's the bottom line. Christ is indeed the life of the believer. And just like Mama breathes for the child and supplies the child with all of the nutrients the child needs to grow. Christ is breathing for you. His life is your breath. His life is your nutrients. His life is keeping you alive. I hear me. Now, what are you supposed to do about that? Code of Romans 6-11 because there are instructions and I'm going to have to move quickly here because of time. But that's Code of Romans 7. Now, if you notice before we got to Romans 6-11 when I was reading the scripture, you kept hearing this word no. Know that our old man was crucified. Know this, know this, know this. Remember that? I think if you went to verse 6 by the time you don't have to go there. But over and over, he says, don't you know or knowing that your old man was crucified, knowing that you were buried with him, knowing that you were raised with him. Here it is. For this union and identification with Christ, this victory with Christ has won for you and which you want because you are in him. To now become part of your experience, first of all, you've got to know. Say the neighbor, you cannot afford to be ignorant. You cannot walk in this victory until you know you already have it. Where, how do you get to know it from the word? How do you get to know it by listening to this sermon 100 times? The point is, for you now to actually walk in the experience of victory, you have to do something. You've got to let it happen. And the first step in letting it happen is for you to know that you have been crucified with Christ. No, that you are dead to sin. No, that you are alive to God. Know it. Spend time in the word. Spend time meditating. Spend time listening. Write it down. Hear it. Over and over. But the first step to the victory is to know you have the victory. Because until you know you have the victory, you will let the one who is defeated still control you. Say it down with love for you to spend your time fighting him. Because as long as you are fighting him, you are not walking in victory. Did you hear me? He will love for you to fight him and fight him and fight him. Because as long as you are fighting him, you are not walking in the victory. Christ has already won. So one of his strategies now is to keep you ignorant. Jesus has already fallen. Jesus has this amazine. He has those who have been able to do it. But if he can keep you ignorant, he can treat you and get you to do what he wants you to do. He can oppress your mind, your will, your emotions, make you full of fear. He can do all of that as long as he can keep the truth from you that you know what this victory has already been won. So what's the first thing you're going to commit to church? Say, I commit to knowing. Amen? Know this. And then here's the second thing. He says you should do what? Recon, say Recon. Recon yourself to be what? Dead. And for emphasis, he said dead indeed. Oh my goodness. Say I'm dead indeed. And man, you know he's a man. That man is rich indeed. You know what that's known? That's known. When someone is rich indeed, they are rich. When someone is fine indeed, they are fine. And when someone is dead indeed, they are. Now, you would think that there are no degrees in death. But it seems like God wonder says there is dead and then there is real dead. And he's saying when it comes to sin, you are what? Some of you are not talking. When it comes to sin, say I am dead indeed. You say I don't feel that it's safe for you. That's a problem. We start trying to live out of our feelings and we make our feelings more truth than the word of God. Your feelings can lie to you. You can feel someone loves you and ain't love you. You can feel that this is the person God has said and this is the person you could have spent your whole life with and that person looking at someone else. Feelings lie all the time, right? You know that. How many times have your feelings that lie to you? You acted upon your feelings only to discover that your feelings were lying. My goodness, man, don't put your faith in feelings. Put your faith in the word of God. Don't put your faith in feelings. Put your faith in the one who can not lie. Put your faith in the one who said you are dead indeed to sin. So stop seeing yourself as alive to sin. And so the scripture says reckon. Not what reckon doesn't mean pretend. It doesn't mean pretend you are dead. It's an accounting term. It means this is a fact. So count on it. Recon it. Factor it in because nothing you do will change it. It's so. So you need to know. Then you need to say you know I'm not only do I know this. I am going to wreck it. It is so. I know what the word says. Not I reckon it. It is so for me. I'm not just dead to sit out and dead. Not what something is dead to something. And you say to me, be sure I'm dead to you. Or you're dead to me. Maybe that's a better. Be sure you're dead to me. What does that mean? And me as well. Don't go, sir. You and me got nothing in common. I don't care about you. I have no interest in you. We're not walking to you. In fact, I don't even want to see your face. And when I walk, I would just walk past you. Like you do not even exist. You are dead to me. Indeed. And man, as some of you know how to be dead to people. You know how to walk by people and act like they're not even there. You know how to withhold your speech from people. Because they did something as far as you concerned. That person is dead to me. They send you a WhatsApp message. You don't respond. They're dead to you. They have an apartheid invite you. You go, please, they're dead to you. People are talking good things about them. You walk away because they're dead to you. My goodness, you're dead. And that should be, look, sin and me. I'm dead to it. There's nothing in me that desires sin. He said, but what about all these feelings? You are not your feelings. You are a born-again child of God. Your spirit is born to Christ. The real you is your spirit. And your spirit has no appetite for sin at all. Those are the facts you need to know. But then you need to make the decision. This is how you let them. You don't have to struggle to do this. You don't have to fight. Who do you have to fight? It's just you making up your mind. You're going to reckon what God said. Let what God said be true to you. Say, I'm dead to sin. And if you're struggling to say that right now, you're the one who needs to say it more often. Until you really start believing it. Because you are in Christ. And Christ is dead to sin. What are you? And you are in Christ. And Christ is alive to God. What are you? That's your spiritual reality. Union identification. Go on next verse very quickly. Yeah, yeah. Therefore do not do what? Do not let sin reign in your mantra about it that you should do what? So yes, the third thing. I know. Because I see the revelation. I reckon. Now I reckon it's a command. But it's not a command to do something. It's a command to believe something. It's a command that we need to obey. But the command does not go quite. But believe that you got peace with God. Believe you. You're selling the grace of God. Believe in this whole. And believe your dead to say, believe it. And then he says, let not. Do not let. Here's the third thing. I told you, Victor is really a matter of letting and letting not. You let the truth that, of Christ, who is your life, the real to you. You let that be true to you. And then you make a decision to let not sin, rule or exercise any dominion over your life. You say, what bishop? Yeah, I'm saying the only way sin can grow over you or me is if we let it. You have to let sin. You have to give. You got to make it easy for sin to come in. Because the sin has to resist you. It's not going to enter. So let's turn around. Instead of you resisting sin in the form of fighting against it. You resist sin by believing. By being steadfast in your faith. The Bible says we fight the fighter faith. Amen? By being steadfast in your faith in believing what? You are dead to sin. You are alive to God. Are you going to leave? And then you let not sin. So when sin comes, it offers itself to you and promises you. All you got to do is say no. Let it, don't let it happen. No, no, I'm not going to let it happen. Sorry. You know, there was a time when you didn't have to power not to sin. Now because you're dead to sin, you have to power not to sin. You just, you have to power not to yield to a daughter fornicate. You simply need to know who you are, reckon it is so. Keep that in your mind and then make the decision when sin comes. No, I'm not letting you, no, I'm not letting you, no. No, no, no. No. No. No, I'm, say no. No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not letting you tip me to commit adultery. No. That's, that's not who I am. I'm dead to you. And you got, you got a, you got a minute time, you got to open your mouth and say it. Because faith works that way. You believe in your heart and you speak out of your mouth. You got to open your mouth. No, no, no. No, I'm not going to do it. Why aren't you going to do it? I'm dead to sin. Why aren't you going to do it? I'm alive to God. And if that's your position, then you let not. So the only way sin can really have to mean in over you is if you do not resist sin and you just let it pass away. But how do you resist sin by believing? Say, I believe I'm dead to sin. I'm alive unto God. The next time you attempt to commit fornication, which really ought to be the easiest thing you, you, you really shouldn't be that hard because it takes a lot to commit fornication. You got to plan it or you got to put yourself in. I mean, that just, it's not one of those things. You know, sometimes you cuss and it's just coming on your mouth before you can think. But fornication, sexual sin, you got to plan that thing. If the first time the thoughts are coming to your mind, you just say, no, I'm not going to let you. You know, no, no. I'm dead to sin, I'm alive to go. Amen. Christ is my life. I'm one with Him. No, no, no. I'm not going to let you have your, no. I hear you. I see this zero better. Okay, everybody say let not. Amen. And hear me. Let me tell you this because when you understand that Christ is your life, then this is how you can receive strength to let not. You can say the life of Christ in me empowers me to say no to sin. Therefore, I let not. Christ is my life and He's empowering me to live holy. Therefore, I will let not. You see, now you're placing your faith in Christ in you for the ability to resist. All right, and then lastly, go on to the next verse. And then we have to conclude. And do what? Do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin. But do what? Present yourselves to God as what? Being alive from the dead and your members. So what do you do? Again, there are certain things you have to do. One, you have to know two, you have to reckon three, you have to decide to let not. Amen? And then thirdly and then fourthly, let. So there are some things you let not, and then there's something you let. And what do you do? You let your members become an instrument of righteousness to God. And how do you let your members become an instrument of righteousness? You present your bodies to Him. Every day, let that be part of your prayer. Lord, this day I present my body to you to be an instrument for righteousness. I let you live your life through me the day, Christ. And bear your fruit in me and through me in Jesus' name. So let's repeat. Say, I am crucified with Christ. I am dead with sin. I am alive to God. I have His light, His nature, and His ability. Working in me all the time. He's breathing in for me. He's exhaling out for me. And I am growing, maturing, being transformed into a perfect man, conform to the image of Jesus. Thank you Lord. This is my reality. In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name? Now, here's my altar call. Here's my altar call. Go back and listen to this message and listen to the one before and the one before and the one before. Listen and listen and listen until you understand it and you can preach it better than I can. Now I think I did a pretty good job. So for you to preach it better, and I know you can, but you're going to have to put some effort into grasping it in Jesus. But seriously, you need to review, remind, go over this until you truly grasp it in Jesus' name. Amen. Father, thank you for today. Thank you for the ministry of your word and the ministry of your spirit. We believe, O God, that you have done something in our hearts and our lives and that this revelation, this truth, that we have received today will take root and it will produce fruit that will change us in Jesus' name and conform us to the image of Christ. From now on, don't fight for victory over sin, over Satan or over self. From now on, stand in a victory that Christ has won and let that victory manifest in your life by believing it and speaking it and declaring it, and renewing your mind with it. If you do that, it will manifest in your life. In Jesus' name. Amen.


## Detailed Transcript with Timestamps

**[00:00 - 00:09]** Father, we thank you now for the time you've given us to use this word to minister to your people and to be transformed.

**[00:09 - 00:21]** In Jesus' name, say today, the word of God will enter my mind and my heart and will transform my life.

**[00:21 - 00:21]** Amen?

**[00:21 - 00:26]** Go ahead, please, and just go on the screen and put the scripture,

**[00:26 - 00:30]** Romans chapter 6, and let's just begin in verse 1.

**[00:30 - 00:34]** But before we read it, I do want to make a comment here.

**[00:34 - 00:40]** We've just preached several messages out of Romans chapter 5.

**[00:40 - 00:42]** And today, we're going to be looking at Romans 6.

**[00:42 - 00:46]** Of course, this is one letter, and there is a continuity.

**[00:46 - 00:49]** So, Romans 6 is definitely connected to Romans 5.

**[00:49 - 00:57]** But in Romans 5, we present it to you what we call the three treasures, the three treasures of salvation.

**[00:57 - 01:01]** Say the three treasures of salvation.

**[01:01 - 01:05]** Can anyone tell me what those three treasures are?

**[01:05 - 01:06]** Peace with God.

**[01:06 - 01:07]** Amen?

**[01:07 - 01:09]** Secondly?

**[01:09 - 01:11]** Secondly what?

**[01:11 - 01:12]** Huh?

**[01:12 - 01:18]** Well, hope is one, but before hope was grace.

**[01:18 - 01:19]** Amen?

**[01:19 - 01:21]** And the third is hope.

**[01:21 - 01:22]** Amen?

**[01:22 - 01:26]** Powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful.

**[01:26 - 01:28]** That was to wake you up.

**[01:28 - 01:38]** Life transforming truths, but they will do you absolutely no good if you've already forgotten them.

**[01:38 - 01:41]** That's why Jesus talks about when he said when the word is preached,

**[01:41 - 01:46]** immediately the enemy comes to steal it, so that it doesn't bear fruit.

**[01:46 - 01:50]** So it becomes your responsibility not to let the enemy steal the truth.

**[01:50 - 01:53]** And the way you do that is by listening over and over,

**[01:53 - 01:56]** you got to write it down, the mean truths, write it down.

**[01:56 - 02:00]** Whatever, whatever you do to retain something, and we're all different,

**[02:00 - 02:04]** but whatever you know helps you to retain what you hear,

**[02:04 - 02:06]** you need to be done it with the word.

**[02:06 - 02:07]** Okay?

**[02:07 - 02:11]** Because while we're providing our so fundamental to your spiritual growth,

**[02:11 - 02:16]** that if you don't have a true revelation of what it means to have peace with God

**[02:16 - 02:24]** to be standing in the grace of God and to have this hope of the glory of God as the anchor

**[02:24 - 02:26]** for your mind, will and emotions.

**[02:26 - 02:28]** You have missed your ABCs.

**[02:28 - 02:32]** And if you can't, if you don't know ABC, you'll never be able to read.

**[02:32 - 02:34]** Okay?

**[02:34 - 02:39]** You've missed your one, two, one plus two, two plus three.

**[02:39 - 02:41]** You've missed the basic math.

**[02:41 - 02:45]** And if you don't know how to add, you're not going to know how to multiply, divide.

**[02:45 - 02:47]** You're not going to do algebra.

**[02:47 - 02:50]** You're not going to do anything.

**[02:50 - 02:54]** You understand that just some things that are so critical to your spiritual growth

**[02:54 - 02:56]** that you have to prioritize.

**[02:56 - 02:58]** Thank God, everything we said is recorded.

**[02:58 - 03:05]** Go back and listen to the series over and over and over again until you can preach it better than I did.

**[03:05 - 03:07]** In Jesus' name.

**[03:07 - 03:14]** So now those were very wonderful truths, but if you are like most Christians,

**[03:14 - 03:17]** you've likely experienced this cycle.

**[03:17 - 03:19]** You've sinned.

**[03:19 - 03:22]** You feel guilty.

**[03:22 - 03:24]** You repent.

**[03:24 - 03:26]** You make up your mind.

**[03:26 - 03:30]** You're really going to try hard not to do that again.

**[03:30 - 03:32]** And then you sin again.

**[03:32 - 03:34]** And you feel guilty.

**[03:34 - 03:36]** And you repent.

**[03:36 - 03:38]** And you make up your mind.

**[03:38 - 03:41]** You're going to try hard again and it's a cycle.

**[03:41 - 03:44]** And you find yourself being frustrated.

**[03:44 - 03:49]** And it feels like the battle you're in, you can never win.

**[03:49 - 03:55]** Now, what if I told you that the secret to victory,

**[03:55 - 04:00]** who was sin, who was Satan, who was self,

**[04:00 - 04:05]** over your physical enemies, real or imagined?

**[04:05 - 04:09]** Because some of us got some imagined ones.

**[04:09 - 04:12]** What if I told you whether they were real or imagined?

**[04:12 - 04:18]** What if I told you the secret to victory isn't about you mustering more willpower?

**[04:18 - 04:21]** What if I said to you,

**[04:21 - 04:26]** the Christian life is less about striving,

**[04:26 - 04:32]** and more about letting and not letting.

**[04:32 - 04:37]** It's less about striving with human effort and determination,

**[04:37 - 04:42]** willpower, and it's more about letting and not letting.

**[04:42 - 04:46]** And I'll talk to you a little bit more about what I'm talking about there.

**[04:46 - 04:50]** What if the battle over sin, Satan, self,

**[04:50 - 04:56]** and your physical enemies once again, real and imagined

**[04:56 - 05:07]** was already won for you by Jesus or by you through Jesus.

**[05:07 - 05:10]** It doesn't matter how you say it, it's the same thing.

**[05:10 - 05:14]** That the battle over sin, the victory,

**[05:14 - 05:20]** has already been won over sin, over Satan, over self,

**[05:20 - 05:23]** over those physical enemies.

**[05:23 - 05:26]** By Christ!

**[05:26 - 05:29]** I'm going to preach my own self-happy if you don't get me.

**[05:29 - 05:35]** By Christ, for me, welcome back back to the money, good to see you.

**[05:35 - 05:44]** Amen? By Christ, for you or by you through Christ.

**[05:44 - 05:49]** It matters not how you say it's the same thing.

**[05:49 - 05:56]** Would you believe me?

**[05:56 - 06:02]** You see the secret to walking in victory is not just right,

**[06:02 - 06:06]** but to let say let.

**[06:07 - 06:12]** Let that victory work itself out in your life.

**[06:12 - 06:15]** That victory that Christ has won for you,

**[06:15 - 06:18]** or that you have won through your union with Christ,

**[06:18 - 06:23]** the secret is to let that work out in your life.

**[06:23 - 06:28]** There's a difference between striving and trying to force something to happen

**[06:28 - 06:30]** and letting it happen.

**[06:30 - 06:35]** Now, your will is involved in letting something happen.

**[06:35 - 06:39]** So, at the end of the day, you got to exercise your will.

**[06:39 - 06:43]** But there's a difference between forcing something and letting something.

**[06:43 - 06:48]** If you came to my house and I didn't invite you,

**[06:48 - 06:53]** and you came with bad intentions and you rang my bell,

**[06:53 - 06:58]** you would have to force yourself to get into my house

**[06:58 - 07:01]** because I am going to resist you.

**[07:01 - 07:04]** And only if you are strong enough and powerful enough

**[07:04 - 07:07]** to get through my door or to get through me,

**[07:07 - 07:09]** will you get into my house?

**[07:09 - 07:17]** And by the way, I am a five-star black belt karate.

**[07:17 - 07:19]** So, don't mess with me now.

**[07:19 - 07:22]** I'll knock you out.

**[07:22 - 07:24]** I'm joking.

**[07:24 - 07:28]** Don't take that for a truth.

**[07:28 - 07:30]** But you can imagine that scenario.

**[07:30 - 07:32]** Versus, I invited you in.

**[07:32 - 07:34]** I invited you to my house, you rang the bell.

**[07:34 - 07:37]** I was simply opening the door and let you in.

**[07:37 - 07:42]** There's a huge difference between having to force your way into something

**[07:42 - 07:47]** and simply letting something happen.

**[07:47 - 07:51]** I still have to open the door to let you in.

**[07:51 - 07:55]** But there's a huge difference between having to force your way in

**[07:55 - 08:03]** and coming through the door once I opened it.

**[08:03 - 08:06]** The victory, the Christian life,

**[08:06 - 08:12]** is not about spreading to win victory,

**[08:12 - 08:16]** over sin, Satan, self, etc.

**[08:16 - 08:20]** But it's about letting the victory,

**[08:20 - 08:23]** that Christ has already won for us,

**[08:23 - 08:28]** worked itself out in our lives.

**[08:28 - 08:31]** Are you still here?

**[08:31 - 08:34]** And so, there's a secret for making that happen.

**[08:34 - 08:39]** And it's this secret that Paul reveals to us in Romans chapter 6.

**[08:39 - 08:43]** And we're going to spend some time looking at it today,

**[08:43 - 08:46]** because we struggle yet,

**[08:46 - 08:49]** even though Christ has done all that he has done.

**[08:49 - 08:53]** And the reason we continue to find ourselves not walking in victory,

**[08:53 - 08:56]** but in a cycle of defeat,

**[08:56 - 09:02]** is because of ignorance or unbelief.

**[09:02 - 09:05]** That's the reason we continue to sin,

**[09:05 - 09:08]** continue to have to mean it over us,

**[09:08 - 09:13]** or Satan continues to exercise power in our lives,

**[09:13 - 09:16]** and we're continuing to feel defeated.

**[09:16 - 09:21]** It's not because your victory is not already accomplished,

**[09:21 - 09:24]** it's because either of ignorance,

**[09:24 - 09:27]** you don't know certain things you should know,

**[09:27 - 09:31]** or even after it has been spoken to you,

**[09:31 - 09:35]** you choose not to believe it.

**[09:35 - 09:41]** See, this is the victory that overcomes the world,

**[09:41 - 09:45]** our faith, our believing.

**[09:45 - 09:47]** What is the victory that overcomes the world?

**[09:47 - 09:50]** Our believing.

**[09:50 - 09:54]** So in Romans chapter 6, Paul reveals what I call the secret of victory

**[09:54 - 09:56]** over these three things.

**[09:56 - 09:59]** And that secret is rooted and grounded in the truth,

**[09:59 - 10:02]** concerning our identification with Christ,

**[10:02 - 10:05]** and our union with Christ.

**[10:05 - 10:11]** So with that in mind, let us go ahead and read Romans chapter 6

**[10:11 - 10:16]** and we're going to read, probably all the way to verse 14.

**[10:16 - 10:21]** Let's stand because I want you to be a lurch while we read.

**[10:21 - 10:23]** And I want you to not just read this,

**[10:23 - 10:24]** but be listening.

**[10:24 - 10:26]** Pay attention to the words being used,

**[10:26 - 10:29]** because we'll be commenting on them in the rest of this message.

**[10:29 - 10:30]** Let's go.

**[10:30 - 10:32]** What shall we say then?

**[10:32 - 10:38]** Shall we continue in sin that graces me about?

**[10:38 - 10:40]** Certainly not.

**[10:40 - 10:45]** How shall we who died to sin?

**[10:45 - 10:47]** We who did what?

**[10:47 - 10:49]** Die to sin.

**[10:49 - 10:51]** Live any longer in it.

**[10:51 - 10:52]** Next verse.

**[10:53 - 10:56]** Or do you not know, say no,

**[10:56 - 11:02]** that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus,

**[11:02 - 11:06]** were baptized into his death.

**[11:06 - 11:16]** Therefore, we say we were buried with him through baptism into death

**[11:16 - 11:21]** that just as Christ was raised from the dead,

**[11:21 - 11:26]** by the just as Christ was raised, say just as.

**[11:26 - 11:31]** Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the power of the Father,

**[11:31 - 11:37]** even so we also should now walk in newness.

**[11:37 - 11:40]** Now walking isn't hard.

**[11:40 - 11:43]** This is so we can walk.

**[11:44 - 11:46]** We can walk.

**[11:46 - 11:51]** He did all of that so we can be able to walk.

**[11:51 - 11:53]** Walking is natural.

**[11:53 - 11:56]** Walking is not a struggle.

**[11:56 - 11:59]** Now you tell me run, I might struggle,

**[11:59 - 12:02]** but I can walk without much effort,

**[12:02 - 12:07]** other than deciding to walk.

**[12:07 - 12:17]** So we also should walk in new form if we have been

**[12:17 - 12:19]** in the likeness of his resurrection.

**[12:19 - 12:20]** Amen.

**[12:20 - 12:21]** Verse 7.

**[12:21 - 12:24]** Knowing, say knowing this,

**[12:24 - 12:29]** that our old man was crucified with him,

**[12:29 - 12:33]** that the body of sin might be what,

**[12:33 - 12:36]** done away with that.

**[12:36 - 12:39]** What is God's purpose that we should no longer be why?

**[12:39 - 12:45]** So God has done something so that sin no longer has dominion over us.

**[12:45 - 12:49]** God has done something so that we should no longer be slaves.

**[12:50 - 13:01]** God has done something so we should be able to simply walk in victory over sin,

**[13:01 - 13:04]** not having to fight for it.

**[13:04 - 13:09]** For he who has, has been.

**[13:09 - 13:10]** All right.

**[13:10 - 13:13]** Now if we die,

**[13:13 - 13:15]** not where it means since.

**[13:15 - 13:18]** Now since this is a fact,

**[13:18 - 13:23]** say now, since we die with Christ,

**[13:23 - 13:29]** we believe that we also live,

**[13:29 - 13:31]** because he lives, we live.

**[13:31 - 13:37]** Knowing that Christ haven't been raised from the dead,

**[13:37 - 13:41]** there's no more death.

**[13:41 - 13:45]** Death no longer has dominion over who?

**[13:45 - 13:48]** Therefore, verse 10,

**[13:48 - 13:51]** for the death that he died,

**[13:51 - 13:55]** he died to sin once for all,

**[13:55 - 13:57]** but the light that he lives,

**[13:57 - 13:59]** he lives to God.

**[13:59 - 14:02]** Now watch what he's going to say next as a result of this.

**[14:02 - 14:04]** Christ died to sin.

**[14:04 - 14:06]** Oh, you went there too quickly by anyway.

**[14:06 - 14:08]** Christ died to sin.

**[14:08 - 14:10]** Go back to verse 10.

**[14:10 - 14:12]** He died to sin.

**[14:12 - 14:14]** How many times?

**[14:14 - 14:15]** How many times?

**[14:15 - 14:19]** Once for all time.

**[14:19 - 14:21]** But the light that now he lives,

**[14:21 - 14:25]** see that's what?

**[14:25 - 14:27]** Now why?

**[14:27 - 14:29]** What should you be your response?

**[14:29 - 14:36]** Likewise, you also reckon yourself to be what?

**[14:36 - 14:38]** Dead indeed to sin,

**[14:38 - 14:47]** but alive to God in Christ died to sin.

**[14:47 - 14:53]** Likewise, you also reckon yourself what?

**[14:53 - 15:02]** But alive to reckon yourself to sin,

**[15:02 - 15:06]** but alive to God.

**[15:06 - 15:11]** In Christ Jesus, our Lord raise your head and say thank you Jesus.

**[15:11 - 15:13]** Next verse, let's go on.

**[15:13 - 15:20]** Therefore, do not let sin, say let sin, let it.

**[15:20 - 15:25]** Let sin reign in your mortal body,

**[15:25 - 15:29]** that you should obey it in its lust.

**[15:29 - 15:38]** And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness,

**[15:38 - 15:43]** but present yourselves to God as being

**[15:43 - 15:53]** and your members as present yourself to God as people who are alive,

**[15:53 - 16:08]** present yourself to him as people who are alive to God.

**[16:08 - 16:18]** And your members as instruments of righteousness to God, verse 14,

**[16:19 - 16:25]** for sin shall now have dominion over you,

**[16:25 - 16:29]** authority over you, it cannot dominate you.

**[16:29 - 16:35]** For now because of what you have done,

**[16:35 - 16:39]** but because of what God has done by grace,

**[16:39 - 16:44]** sin has lost its dominion of power over you.

**[16:44 - 16:47]** So if you are still struggling with sin,

**[16:47 - 16:50]** it's because of ignorance of unbelief.

**[16:50 - 16:53]** And so what we wanted you today is to explain this,

**[16:53 - 16:55]** use a few illustrations to help you

**[16:55 - 16:58]** so that you will no longer be ignorant if you are,

**[16:58 - 17:02]** or you will believe if you have not been believing.

**[17:02 - 17:04]** Because you see you can read all of that

**[17:04 - 17:08]** and then still approach your victory over sin

**[17:08 - 17:11]** as though Christ has done nothing about it,

**[17:11 - 17:15]** that the battle now is still yours.

**[17:15 - 17:17]** Please receive it.

**[17:17 - 17:21]** So what are we going to do?

**[17:21 - 17:24]** We're going to uncover how this truth is the key to experiencing

**[17:24 - 17:26]** real freedom from birth.

**[17:26 - 17:29]** What is this truth that I'm talking about?

**[17:29 - 17:35]** It's the truth of our identification and union with Christ.

**[17:35 - 17:39]** One motivated God to bring the established peace

**[17:39 - 17:42]** to give us grace, to give us hope.

**[17:42 - 17:44]** What motivated him is the love of God.

**[17:44 - 17:46]** The Bible talks about that in Romans 5.

**[17:46 - 17:48]** It is the love of God.

**[17:48 - 17:51]** God commanded his love for us

**[17:51 - 17:55]** and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

**[17:55 - 18:00]** So it is God's love that caused him to do whatever he did

**[18:00 - 18:03]** so that there would be peace and there would be grace

**[18:03 - 18:05]** and there would be hope in your life.

**[18:05 - 18:07]** So thank God for loving us so much.

**[18:07 - 18:09]** Listen, never take that for granted

**[18:09 - 18:12]** because just imagine if God was evil.

**[18:12 - 18:15]** Just imagine if God was wicked.

**[18:16 - 18:19]** Just imagine if God was a slave master.

**[18:19 - 18:23]** Can you imagine what your life would be like?

**[18:23 - 18:26]** Thank God he is none of that.

**[18:26 - 18:28]** But God is love.

**[18:28 - 18:32]** And we who are his children, we are the objects of his love.

**[18:32 - 18:33]** Let me tell you something else.

**[18:33 - 18:35]** God loves everybody.

**[18:35 - 18:40]** But God's children are his favorites.

**[18:40 - 18:43]** God favors you over the unbeliever.

**[18:45 - 18:47]** And then, I mean, your parent, your man,

**[18:47 - 18:49]** you're supposed to love everybody's children

**[18:49 - 18:50]** and be good to everybody.

**[18:50 - 18:52]** Yeah, but you favor your own.

**[18:52 - 18:57]** And you will be wrong not to favor your own.

**[18:57 - 18:59]** You'll be wrong to say, you know what?

**[18:59 - 19:01]** I love other children just as much.

**[19:01 - 19:03]** No, you're supposed to love your children more.

**[19:03 - 19:05]** You're supposed to favor your children more.

**[19:05 - 19:07]** Doesn't mean you can't love other kids and help them.

**[19:07 - 19:09]** But as a father, as a mother,

**[19:09 - 19:13]** you're supposed to have a special love for your children.

**[19:13 - 19:16]** And if you don't, something's wrong with you, okay?

**[19:16 - 19:18]** So God loves the whole world.

**[19:18 - 19:22]** But the truth is God favors us.

**[19:22 - 19:25]** Those of us who are in Christ.

**[19:25 - 19:28]** Those of us who are believing and trusting in Jesus

**[19:28 - 19:31]** and Jesus the Savior, Lord, God favors us

**[19:31 - 19:34]** because we are his kids.

**[19:34 - 19:36]** In a way that the world is not.

**[19:36 - 19:41]** Come and raise your heads and thank you, Lord.

**[19:41 - 19:45]** For loving me and favoring me.

**[19:45 - 19:48]** So it is this love of God that has motivated God

**[19:48 - 19:51]** to do everything he has done.

**[19:51 - 19:55]** But God has followed a particular process.

**[19:55 - 19:59]** He has to do it in a certain way to accomplish it.

**[19:59 - 20:00]** Amen?

**[20:00 - 20:01]** He has to do that.

**[20:01 - 20:04]** You see because the problem of the sinner

**[20:04 - 20:07]** is not that he's bad.

**[20:07 - 20:10]** The problem of the sinner is that he's dead.

**[20:10 - 20:14]** And the only thing that can help a dead man is life.

**[20:14 - 20:18]** A dead man has no other,

**[20:18 - 20:22]** there is absolutely nothing you can do for a dead man

**[20:22 - 20:25]** that will improve his situation.

**[20:25 - 20:27]** One bit you can do,

**[20:27 - 20:29]** what can you do for a dead man

**[20:29 - 20:32]** that will make his situation better?

**[20:32 - 20:35]** You cannot do anything to help him.

**[20:35 - 20:37]** The only thing you can do for a dead man

**[20:37 - 20:40]** that will make a difference is to give him life.

**[20:40 - 20:43]** You hear me?

**[20:43 - 20:48]** So the problem that we had was a problem that produced death

**[20:48 - 20:53]** and the only thing that could change our circumstances

**[20:53 - 20:56]** was for us to receive life.

**[20:56 - 21:00]** And God is the only one who can give life.

**[21:00 - 21:03]** And thank God the whole plan of salvation

**[21:03 - 21:08]** was designed to give us life.

**[21:08 - 21:11]** So now that you are in Christ, this is what you have.

**[21:11 - 21:14]** You have life.

**[21:14 - 21:17]** Jesus says, I have come that you may have what?

**[21:17 - 21:18]** What?

**[21:18 - 21:20]** That's what you needed.

**[21:20 - 21:23]** Nicodemus, you've got to be born again.

**[21:23 - 21:26]** Nicodemus, you need life.

**[21:26 - 21:29]** I have come so you may have life

**[21:29 - 21:33]** and have it more, more what?

**[21:33 - 21:35]** Abundantly.

**[21:35 - 21:38]** Now, we need to grasp this revelation

**[21:38 - 21:40]** about densification and union

**[21:40 - 21:43]** because the whole purpose for this doctrine

**[21:43 - 21:46]** of identification, union with Christ,

**[21:46 - 21:49]** is because it is the means

**[21:49 - 21:53]** by which God gives to dead people life.

**[21:53 - 21:56]** And that light is what transforms them.

**[21:56 - 22:00]** It is that light that gives them dominion over sin.

**[22:00 - 22:03]** It's that light that gives them dominion over Satan.

**[22:03 - 22:06]** It's that light that gives them dominion over self.

**[22:06 - 22:10]** It's that light that gives them dominion over enemies.

**[22:10 - 22:13]** The life that they lack because of sin

**[22:13 - 22:15]** is what God has given us

**[22:15 - 22:17]** for God to do that.

**[22:17 - 22:19]** He implemented this plan

**[22:19 - 22:23]** that theologians refer to as identification with Christ

**[22:23 - 22:27]** or union with Christ.

**[22:27 - 22:29]** Amen?

**[22:29 - 22:30]** So hear me.

**[22:30 - 22:33]** The approach that many of us have

**[22:33 - 22:35]** in terms of living the Christian life,

**[22:35 - 22:38]** in terms of sanctification.

**[22:38 - 22:43]** The approach is to come to God with the attitude

**[22:43 - 22:47]** or to approach the Christian life with the attitude.

**[22:47 - 22:51]** Lord, you have saved me in terms of,

**[22:51 - 22:53]** you know, you've forgiven my sins

**[22:53 - 22:55]** and by the grace of God I'm going to heaven.

**[22:55 - 22:59]** Now, I'm going to do my part by dying to sin.

**[22:59 - 23:01]** How many of you heard this?

**[23:01 - 23:02]** Died to sin.

**[23:02 - 23:03]** You got to die to sin.

**[23:03 - 23:04]** You heard that before?

**[23:04 - 23:05]** Raise your hand.

**[23:05 - 23:06]** Have you heard that before?

**[23:06 - 23:07]** Yeah.

**[23:07 - 23:10]** How many of you have been trying to die to sin every day?

**[23:10 - 23:12]** No, I mean, you're telling me the truth.

**[23:12 - 23:13]** Not more.

**[23:13 - 23:15]** You should be lifting your hands.

**[23:15 - 23:16]** Amen.

**[23:16 - 23:17]** You've been trying to die to sin.

**[23:17 - 23:18]** You've got to die to sin.

**[23:18 - 23:19]** You've got to die to sin.

**[23:19 - 23:21]** You've got to die to sin.

**[23:21 - 23:22]** How many of you know

**[23:22 - 23:25]** that the Bible never commands you to die to sin?

**[23:25 - 23:31]** Why doesn't the Bible say

**[23:31 - 23:32]** you'll believe a die to sin?

**[23:32 - 23:34]** The answer is because you just read.

**[23:34 - 23:36]** You are dead to sin.

**[23:36 - 23:38]** Then you read.

**[23:38 - 23:40]** You are dead to sin.

**[23:40 - 23:44]** And you should present yourself to God as a lie from the dead.

**[23:44 - 23:48]** So if you are supposed to be presenting yourself as a lie,

**[23:48 - 23:49]** why?

**[23:49 - 23:50]** You know?

**[23:50 - 23:51]** To God.

**[23:51 - 23:52]** Why?

**[23:52 - 23:55]** The Bible doesn't say

**[23:55 - 23:57]** to the believer die to sin.

**[23:57 - 23:59]** The Bible says to the believer.

**[23:59 - 24:01]** You are dead to sin.

**[24:01 - 24:04]** And you are a lie to God.

**[24:04 - 24:06]** So one of the reasons for your failure

**[24:06 - 24:08]** is you're trying to die to something you're dead to.

**[24:08 - 24:11]** Which means you're ignorant

**[24:11 - 24:13]** or you're not believing.

**[24:13 - 24:15]** And that opens the door for the enemy.

**[24:15 - 24:17]** You are not able to walk in the power

**[24:17 - 24:19]** of what God has done

**[24:19 - 24:21]** because you're either ignorant

**[24:21 - 24:23]** or you don't believe it.

**[24:23 - 24:27]** You're preaching good.

**[24:27 - 24:32]** The scripture says you're dead to sin.

**[24:32 - 24:34]** You say I've got to die to sin.

**[24:34 - 24:36]** That means you're challenging God's word.

**[24:36 - 24:38]** You refuse to believe God's word.

**[24:38 - 24:39]** You think you know more.

**[24:39 - 24:41]** And you think you're being humble.

**[24:41 - 24:42]** Now the truth is,

**[24:42 - 24:43]** many of you believe that

**[24:43 - 24:45]** because we preach a soul to you that.

**[24:45 - 24:48]** Now you ought to read the Bible for yourself.

**[24:48 - 24:52]** But since you don't read it much for yourself,

**[24:52 - 24:55]** of course you depend upon preachers.

**[24:55 - 24:57]** So you better hope you're listening to the truth

**[24:57 - 25:01]** because many preachers are not preaching the truth.

**[25:01 - 25:04]** But the truth is you are what?

**[25:04 - 25:06]** Yeah, believers are dead to sin.

**[25:06 - 25:07]** Believers are what?

**[25:07 - 25:09]** Alive to God.

**[25:09 - 25:12]** So dying, I've got to die.

**[25:12 - 25:16]** He said, but Bishop didn't say he died daily.

**[25:16 - 25:18]** But yeah, Paul said I died daily.

**[25:18 - 25:21]** He didn't say I died to sin daily.

**[25:21 - 25:24]** You're the one who said Paul said

**[25:24 - 25:27]** he had to die to sin daily.

**[25:27 - 25:29]** What was Paul talking about?

**[25:29 - 25:30]** Read the context.

**[25:30 - 25:32]** And you'll see Paul was not talking about sin.

**[25:32 - 25:34]** When Paul said I died daily,

**[25:34 - 25:37]** he was talking about all the persecutions,

**[25:37 - 25:39]** all the things he went through physically

**[25:39 - 25:42]** where he was exposed to death.

**[25:42 - 25:46]** Every day just about he was subject to something

**[25:46 - 25:49]** because he was so bold,

**[25:49 - 25:51]** so committed in doing God's work,

**[25:51 - 25:53]** he went through all kinds of things.

**[25:53 - 25:54]** He was arrested.

**[25:54 - 25:55]** He was beaten.

**[25:55 - 25:57]** They were chasing him from one place to the other.

**[25:57 - 25:59]** He had to constantly be hiding

**[25:59 - 26:03]** because every day his life was on the line.

**[26:03 - 26:04]** For what he believes.

**[26:04 - 26:06]** So Paul was talking about the persecution

**[26:06 - 26:10]** and the suffering and all that he had to go through physically

**[26:10 - 26:12]** for the sake of the gospel.

**[26:12 - 26:14]** So when he says I died daily,

**[26:14 - 26:17]** he was talking about those things on a daily basis.

**[26:17 - 26:21]** He had to die or he was facing death

**[26:21 - 26:27]** for the cause of Christ.

**[26:27 - 26:32]** But as regards to sin,

**[26:32 - 26:35]** the scriptures are very clear.

**[26:35 - 26:36]** You are what?

**[26:36 - 26:39]** Death to sin.

**[26:39 - 26:41]** And you're supposed to do what?

**[26:41 - 26:49]** Present yourself to God as those who are alive to God.

**[26:49 - 26:53]** Alive to righteousness.

**[26:53 - 26:55]** So when you continue to see yourself

**[26:55 - 26:59]** as a sinner trying to win victory over sin,

**[26:59 - 27:01]** you don't realize or you're not believing

**[27:01 - 27:05]** that the victory over sin has already been won.

**[27:05 - 27:10]** So you're getting ready to fight.

**[27:10 - 27:13]** Every day you're fighting for victory

**[27:13 - 27:17]** that Christ has already won for you.

**[27:17 - 27:24]** Or you have already won in Christ.

**[27:24 - 27:31]** Either way, you're already a victor.

**[27:31 - 27:34]** Raise your hands and say thank you Lord.

**[27:34 - 27:36]** Hallelujah.

**[27:36 - 27:38]** Amen.

**[27:38 - 27:42]** I'm still feeling the pull of sin.

**[27:42 - 27:44]** Well again, that's why we need to understand

**[27:44 - 27:45]** what happened when we were saved.

**[27:45 - 27:49]** So let me talk about identification.

**[27:49 - 27:52]** Identification is this doctrine or this truth

**[27:52 - 27:55]** that in the plan of salvation,

**[27:55 - 27:59]** God placed us in Christ.

**[27:59 - 28:03]** God joined us to Jesus

**[28:03 - 28:07]** and God made us one with Him.

**[28:07 - 28:11]** Identification is not just a legal transaction,

**[28:11 - 28:14]** it's not just a nice metaphor.

**[28:14 - 28:17]** It's not just a way to illustrate something,

**[28:17 - 28:19]** to help you understand it.

**[28:19 - 28:22]** Identification is real.

**[28:22 - 28:24]** Union with Christ is real.

**[28:24 - 28:26]** It's a spiritual reality.

**[28:26 - 28:29]** When the Bible says we are in Christ,

**[28:29 - 28:32]** this is not figuratively speaking.

**[28:32 - 28:36]** It is because you are actually vitally in Christ,

**[28:36 - 28:39]** actually vitally connected to Him.

**[28:39 - 28:42]** Christ is indeed your life.

**[28:42 - 28:44]** Are you hear me?

**[28:44 - 28:46]** You are unified to Him.

**[28:46 - 28:50]** And this is why we read in Romans 6.3.5.

**[28:50 - 28:55]** Romans 6.3.5 says that we were baptized into Christ Jesus.

**[28:55 - 28:59]** It says that Jesus, that we were buried with Jesus.

**[28:59 - 29:03]** It says that we were raised with Jesus.

**[29:03 - 29:06]** It says that we now have the life of Jesus.

**[29:06 - 29:10]** Ephesians 2 tells us we are seated with Jesus.

**[29:10 - 29:14]** All of those verses point to a reality.

**[29:14 - 29:18]** It's like me saying, Elder Morty is sitting in this chair.

**[29:18 - 29:21]** I'm not saying we should pretend he's sitting there.

**[29:21 - 29:23]** Imagine he's sitting there.

**[29:23 - 29:27]** Have it in our mind because of the power of positive thinking.

**[29:27 - 29:31]** If we think it long enough and we consider it long enough,

**[29:31 - 29:33]** it will become no.

**[29:33 - 29:35]** If I say he is sitting in that chair,

**[29:35 - 29:38]** it's because he is sitting there.

**[29:38 - 29:39]** If I say to you today,

**[29:39 - 29:41]** you are gathered at harvest.

**[29:41 - 29:43]** It's because you are gathered.

**[29:43 - 29:45]** This is so.

**[29:45 - 29:49]** So when the Bible says we died with Christ

**[29:49 - 29:52]** and we were buried with Christ

**[29:52 - 29:54]** and we were risen with Christ

**[29:54 - 29:56]** and we ascended with Christ.

**[29:56 - 29:58]** And we are seated with Christ.

**[29:58 - 30:03]** Those things are spiritual reality.

**[30:03 - 30:06]** All right?

**[30:06 - 30:13]** Say we are in Christ for real.

**[30:13 - 30:17]** Say we are in Christ for true.

**[30:17 - 30:19]** Say true true.

**[30:19 - 30:23]** We are in Christ.

**[30:23 - 30:31]** Now, that changes your story.

**[30:31 - 30:33]** You see, you are used to telling your story

**[30:33 - 30:36]** but are considering this part of your story.

**[30:36 - 30:40]** You tell your story only in terms of your physical experiences.

**[30:40 - 30:42]** That's for you, it's your story.

**[30:42 - 30:45]** But there's a story of your life

**[30:45 - 30:48]** that is revealed to you

**[30:48 - 30:53]** in the word that you must take into account

**[30:53 - 30:56]** as real when you're dealing with sin,

**[30:56 - 30:58]** you're dealing with Satan,

**[30:58 - 31:00]** you're dealing with self,

**[31:00 - 31:02]** you're dealing with the enemies.

**[31:02 - 31:05]** You must take this at real

**[31:05 - 31:08]** and pray from that reality.

**[31:08 - 31:10]** Speak from that reality.

**[31:10 - 31:12]** Act from that reality.

**[31:12 - 31:15]** Conduct yourself from that reality.

**[31:15 - 31:20]** I am in Christ joined to Him.

**[31:20 - 31:26]** Now, if you are in Christ and joined to Him,

**[31:26 - 31:31]** then everything Christ goes through

**[31:31 - 31:40]** or experiences you are going to experience with Him.

**[31:40 - 31:44]** Every victory He wins, you're going to win in Him.

**[31:44 - 31:48]** Every place He moves through, you're going to go there

**[31:48 - 31:50]** because you're in Him.

**[31:50 - 31:52]** Let me use an illustration.

**[31:52 - 31:56]** Here is a book, and I want to put this handkerchief

**[31:56 - 31:58]** inside the book.

**[31:58 - 32:03]** Where's the handkerchief?

**[32:03 - 32:05]** Where's the book?

**[32:05 - 32:06]** In my hand.

**[32:06 - 32:10]** Where's the handkerchief?

**[32:10 - 32:11]** In my hand.

**[32:11 - 32:16]** Where's the book?

**[32:16 - 32:21]** Where's the handkerchief?

**[32:21 - 32:22]** Forgive me.

**[32:22 - 32:25]** Where's the book?

**[32:25 - 32:29]** Where's the handkerchief?

**[32:29 - 32:31]** Where's the book?

**[32:31 - 32:33]** Where's the handkerchief?

**[32:33 - 32:37]** As long as the handkerchief is in this book,

**[32:37 - 32:40]** everywhere the book goes,

**[32:40 - 32:42]** the handkerchief goes.

**[32:42 - 32:47]** Are you hear me?

**[32:47 - 32:49]** And that is the reality.

**[32:49 - 32:52]** You are in Christ.

**[32:52 - 32:54]** God put you in Him.

**[32:54 - 32:56]** Now, you say, how God did that?

**[32:56 - 32:58]** Well, God can do anything God wants to do,

**[32:58 - 33:00]** and you don't have to understand.

**[33:00 - 33:03]** You don't even know how you're hitting you.

**[33:03 - 33:04]** Let's come on.

**[33:04 - 33:08]** God, well, your little peanut brain,

**[33:08 - 33:11]** do you think you are able to understand

**[33:11 - 33:13]** all that God is capable of doing?

**[33:13 - 33:16]** You have to be able to explain God's work

**[33:16 - 33:19]** to understand and believe what God has done.

**[33:19 - 33:24]** I don't know how God did this,

**[33:24 - 33:27]** but he performed some kind of surgery on Calvary.

**[33:27 - 33:33]** He did something and put you inside of Jesus

**[33:33 - 33:36]** and joined your spirit to His

**[33:36 - 33:40]** so that everything Jesus goes through,

**[33:40 - 33:42]** you actually go through.

**[33:42 - 33:47]** So that His story becomes your story.

**[33:47 - 33:51]** As long as this handkerchief is in this book,

**[33:51 - 33:55]** this story of this book will be the history

**[33:55 - 33:57]** of the handkerchief.

**[33:57 - 34:03]** Say hallelujah.

**[34:03 - 34:08]** So when Jesus went to the cross,

**[34:08 - 34:10]** because you were in Him,

**[34:10 - 34:18]** you also went to the cross.

**[34:18 - 34:22]** When Jesus died,

**[34:22 - 34:24]** you were in Him.

**[34:24 - 34:26]** What did Jesus die to?

**[34:26 - 34:27]** Sin.

**[34:27 - 34:29]** What did you die to?

**[34:29 - 34:38]** When they buried Jesus in the tomb,

**[34:38 - 34:40]** where were you?

**[34:40 - 34:43]** In Jesus in the tomb.

**[34:43 - 34:46]** So you were buried also with Him.

**[34:46 - 34:49]** What? You were in Him.

**[34:49 - 34:52]** And on Sunday morning when He resurrected,

**[34:52 - 34:59]** He had overcome sin.

**[34:59 - 35:02]** He had overcome Satan.

**[35:02 - 35:05]** He had overcome the old man.

**[35:05 - 35:07]** He had overcome the world.

**[35:07 - 35:10]** He had even overcome death.

**[35:10 - 35:13]** And when He overcame all of those things on Sunday,

**[35:13 - 35:15]** where were you?

**[35:15 - 35:17]** So what were you doing?

**[35:17 - 35:19]** Overcoming.

**[35:19 - 35:22]** You are doing what?

**[35:22 - 35:24]** Overcoming.

**[35:24 - 35:29]** When He faced principality and powers

**[35:29 - 35:31]** and defeated them,

**[35:31 - 35:33]** when He defeated Satan,

**[35:33 - 35:35]** where were you?

**[35:35 - 35:37]** What were you doing?

**[35:37 - 35:50]** So that the victory Jesus won over Satan

**[35:50 - 35:54]** and over sin and over self,

**[35:54 - 35:56]** the victory He won,

**[35:56 - 36:00]** the defeat of Satan was your victory.

**[36:00 - 36:03]** The defeat of Satan by Jesus was,

**[36:03 - 36:06]** in fact, your victory over Satan.

**[36:06 - 36:07]** Over sin.

**[36:07 - 36:13]** Do you understand?

**[36:13 - 36:17]** Now, you cannot believe that until you fundamentally believe

**[36:17 - 36:18]** you are in Him.

**[36:18 - 36:20]** If you don't believe you are in Him,

**[36:20 - 36:23]** then none of the things I said you can embrace.

**[36:23 - 36:27]** So at the very core of Christianity,

**[36:27 - 36:30]** at the very essence of your faith,

**[36:30 - 36:35]** is this understanding of God's plan of salvation?

**[36:35 - 36:38]** God is in Christ,

**[36:38 - 36:41]** and God has placed you in Christ,

**[36:41 - 36:43]** and joined you to Him.

**[36:43 - 36:45]** I said on Friday night,

**[36:45 - 36:46]** I said something about tea,

**[36:46 - 36:49]** and my sister here was so blessed by that.

**[36:49 - 36:51]** Yeah, she came to me and thanked me.

**[36:51 - 36:53]** I said, listen,

**[36:53 - 36:56]** when you have water,

**[36:56 - 37:01]** and you place a tea bag

**[37:01 - 37:04]** into the water,

**[37:04 - 37:07]** it is because you want the water to become like tea.

**[37:07 - 37:12]** Are you listening to me?

**[37:12 - 37:14]** And so you got water there and walked up,

**[37:14 - 37:16]** but when you put the tea bag in it,

**[37:16 - 37:17]** you call it now,

**[37:17 - 37:21]** tea because it ticks on the qualities of the tea.

**[37:21 - 37:23]** The reason God puts Christ in you

**[37:23 - 37:28]** and you in Christ is because God wants you to become like Jesus.

**[37:28 - 37:33]** And God accomplishes it by putting Christ in you.

**[37:33 - 37:37]** If you want to drink tea,

**[37:37 - 37:40]** what are you going to do?

**[37:40 - 37:42]** You're going to find tea

**[37:42 - 37:44]** and put it in the water

**[37:44 - 37:47]** so that the water becomes tea.

**[37:47 - 37:49]** God wants you to be like Jesus.

**[37:49 - 37:51]** What does God do?

**[37:51 - 37:53]** He takes Jesus,

**[37:53 - 37:55]** and put Jesus in you,

**[37:55 - 37:57]** and you in Jesus,

**[37:57 - 37:59]** and you become like Jesus.

**[37:59 - 38:04]** Hallelujah.

**[38:04 - 38:06]** So now the Bible says,

**[38:06 - 38:08]** we are an aroma.

**[38:08 - 38:10]** We are what?

**[38:10 - 38:12]** And a aroma of Christ.

**[38:12 - 38:14]** Why? Because it's in us,

**[38:14 - 38:20]** and we are in Him.

**[38:20 - 38:22]** When you understand this,

**[38:22 - 38:25]** then the reality that I shared earlier,

**[38:25 - 38:29]** the picture over sin is not about fighting,

**[38:29 - 38:31]** it's about letting.

**[38:31 - 38:35]** Letting what has already happened,

**[38:35 - 38:37]** happened in your experience.

**[38:37 - 38:41]** Let me just work out in your life.

**[38:41 - 38:46]** Letting what has already happened,

**[38:46 - 38:50]** happened by believing.

**[38:50 - 38:52]** In your experience,

**[38:52 - 38:57]** you keep struggling,

**[38:57 - 38:58]** you keep struggling,

**[38:58 - 39:00]** and you will continue to struggle

**[39:00 - 39:04]** until you embrace fully this revelation

**[39:04 - 39:06]** of your union

**[39:06 - 39:09]** and identification with Christ.

**[39:09 - 39:11]** That's Christianity.

**[39:11 - 39:14]** Christianity is not imitation,

**[39:14 - 39:16]** it's participation

**[39:16 - 39:18]** in the very life of Christ.

**[39:18 - 39:23]** Christianity is not imitation,

**[39:23 - 39:25]** it's participation

**[39:25 - 39:32]** in the life of the Son of God.

**[39:32 - 39:37]** Let me give you at least one or two more illustrations.

**[39:37 - 39:40]** This one is the relationship

**[39:40 - 39:42]** between a baby in the womb

**[39:42 - 39:47]** of her mother or his mother and the mother.

**[39:47 - 39:51]** A baby in the womb

**[39:51 - 39:56]** of her mother is a person,

**[39:56 - 40:03]** has its own existence.

**[40:03 - 40:05]** It's a person by the same time

**[40:05 - 40:08]** that baby is one

**[40:08 - 40:11]** with her mother

**[40:11 - 40:14]** for all practical purposes.

**[40:14 - 40:17]** That baby lives

**[40:17 - 40:21]** because the mother lives.

**[40:21 - 40:23]** And that baby is able to grow

**[40:23 - 40:24]** and develop

**[40:24 - 40:28]** and at some point become a fully functional adult

**[40:28 - 40:31]** because while in her mother's womb,

**[40:31 - 40:35]** she was joined to her mother.

**[40:35 - 40:38]** And everything she needed

**[40:38 - 40:41]** to live and grow was being supplied

**[40:41 - 40:45]** through her union with her mother.

**[40:45 - 40:47]** Thank God for the umbilical cord.

**[40:47 - 40:53]** That umbilical cord

**[40:53 - 40:56]** connects the baby to her mother.

**[40:56 - 40:59]** So that what the baby needs

**[40:59 - 41:02]** to live and grow is actually being supplied

**[41:02 - 41:04]** continually by the mother.

**[41:04 - 41:08]** You know that baby cannot breathe.

**[41:08 - 41:11]** Yet the baby needs oxygen.

**[41:11 - 41:12]** Oxygen, oxygen.

**[41:12 - 41:14]** The mother must have oxygen

**[41:14 - 41:16]** or it cannot live.

**[41:16 - 41:18]** And so what happens?

**[41:18 - 41:22]** Mother breathes for her baby.

**[41:22 - 41:26]** The oxygen, the mother needs that baby needs.

**[41:26 - 41:29]** The mother takes it in

**[41:29 - 41:33]** and then supplies it via the umbilical cord

**[41:33 - 41:35]** to the bloodstream of the baby

**[41:35 - 41:38]** so that the baby has oxygen.

**[41:38 - 41:42]** Literally, mother is breathing for the baby.

**[41:42 - 41:44]** And the mother can breathe for the baby

**[41:44 - 41:46]** because they are joined together.

**[41:46 - 41:47]** They are one.

**[41:47 - 41:52]** And then you know you got to breathe in.

**[41:52 - 41:54]** You need oxygen, but then you got to breathe out

**[41:54 - 41:55]** because you got to exhale

**[41:55 - 41:58]** and you got to get rid of the carbon dioxide.

**[41:58 - 42:02]** If the carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream of the baby,

**[42:02 - 42:05]** the baby dies because it's poisonous.

**[42:05 - 42:08]** So mother has to breathe in,

**[42:08 - 42:10]** inhale for the baby,

**[42:10 - 42:14]** in order to supply the oxygen

**[42:14 - 42:16]** that the baby needs,

**[42:16 - 42:18]** the breath of life,

**[42:18 - 42:20]** the spirit, whatever you want to call it,

**[42:20 - 42:23]** is there being breathed in

**[42:23 - 42:25]** the bloodstream of the baby?

**[42:25 - 42:28]** And then when the baby produces the waste,

**[42:28 - 42:29]** the carbon dioxide,

**[42:29 - 42:31]** other things, guess what?

**[42:31 - 42:34]** That waste gets back into the bloodstream of the mother.

**[42:34 - 42:38]** Goes to the lungs of the mother

**[42:38 - 42:41]** so the mother can exhale it.

**[42:41 - 42:43]** Goes to the kidneys of the mother

**[42:43 - 42:48]** so the mother can excrete it.

**[42:48 - 42:50]** So for nine months,

**[42:50 - 42:52]** that baby in the womb

**[42:52 - 42:55]** is totally completely dependent.

**[42:55 - 42:57]** It assesses all that baby is doing,

**[42:57 - 43:01]** is let mom breathe for her.

**[43:01 - 43:04]** Let mom inhale and let mom exhale.

**[43:04 - 43:06]** Let mom, and I'll just through the umbilical cord,

**[43:06 - 43:08]** I'll just let it happen.

**[43:08 - 43:10]** Are you hearing me?

**[43:10 - 43:11]** Are you hearing me?

**[43:11 - 43:12]** And as a result,

**[43:12 - 43:15]** our process of baby is able to grow,

**[43:15 - 43:18]** develop, and one day become

**[43:18 - 43:21]** a fully functional human being,

**[43:21 - 43:24]** a fully functional adult.

**[43:25 - 43:28]** But that union in the womb of mom

**[43:28 - 43:32]** was absolutely essential.

**[43:32 - 43:36]** Now, sometimes something goes wrong with that process.

**[43:36 - 43:42]** Something interferes with the baby's growth and development.

**[43:42 - 43:44]** Maybe something happens.

**[43:44 - 43:47]** And the doctors have the ability,

**[43:47 - 43:49]** skilled surgeons have the ability

**[43:49 - 43:52]** to open up a perform surgery.

**[43:52 - 43:56]** Go in, they call it open fetal surgery,

**[43:56 - 44:00]** and take the baby out of the mother's womb.

**[44:00 - 44:03]** And the baby now exists outside

**[44:03 - 44:06]** and perform a surgical procedure

**[44:06 - 44:09]** that may be required to save the baby's life.

**[44:09 - 44:13]** And then put the baby back into the womb

**[44:13 - 44:16]** and seal the womb.

**[44:16 - 44:18]** And that baby continues now,

**[44:18 - 44:20]** because the pregnancy continues

**[44:20 - 44:23]** and the baby continues to feed off

**[44:23 - 44:26]** and breathe of and receive

**[44:26 - 44:29]** from her mother whatever she needs

**[44:29 - 44:33]** until she is able to be born.

**[44:33 - 44:39]** Now, that's a picture of South Asia.

**[44:39 - 44:41]** That's the way it was supposed to be

**[44:41 - 44:42]** what human beings were created

**[44:42 - 44:45]** were supposed to be dependent upon God

**[44:45 - 44:48]** for everything God breathing for us,

**[44:48 - 44:50]** God exhaling for us.

**[44:50 - 44:52]** Are you hear me?

**[44:52 - 44:54]** We are individual, but yet we're so joined

**[44:54 - 44:56]** to him, we're one with him.

**[44:56 - 44:58]** But then sin entered.

**[44:58 - 45:00]** And we're sin entered the umbilical cord.

**[45:00 - 45:02]** That spiritual umbilical cord

**[45:02 - 45:05]** that connected us to God was cut.

**[45:05 - 45:09]** We now found ourselves living externally

**[45:09 - 45:11]** and the Bible says in that condition

**[45:11 - 45:13]** we were in fact dead to sin.

**[45:13 - 45:15]** Dead in sin, excuse me.

**[45:15 - 45:17]** We're dead in sin.

**[45:17 - 45:19]** We're dead to God.

**[45:19 - 45:21]** And we were descending into hell

**[45:21 - 45:23]** into eternal destruction.

**[45:23 - 45:26]** There was a need for emergency intervention.

**[45:26 - 45:28]** Someone needed to intervene

**[45:28 - 45:30]** in order to perform the necessary

**[45:30 - 45:33]** surgical procedures that will allow us

**[45:33 - 45:36]** not to eternally be destroyed by the lathe.

**[45:36 - 45:38]** And thank God, the only one

**[45:38 - 45:40]** who could oh my goodness.

**[45:40 - 45:42]** I said, thank God for the physicians

**[45:42 - 45:44]** who sometimes can perform surgery

**[45:44 - 45:46]** and save the physical life of a baby.

**[45:46 - 45:49]** But only God could intervene

**[45:49 - 45:51]** and bring life to us.

**[45:51 - 45:52]** And so what did God do?

**[45:52 - 45:53]** He did it.

**[45:53 - 45:56]** Through Jesus Christ on the cross,

**[45:56 - 45:59]** God performed spiritual surgery.

**[45:59 - 46:01]** He literally performed operation.

**[46:01 - 46:03]** He opened Jesus up.

**[46:03 - 46:06]** He restored the broken umbilical cord

**[46:06 - 46:08]** and he took us.

**[46:08 - 46:13]** And he put us right back inside of Jesus.

**[46:14 - 46:18]** And then he closed the wound

**[46:18 - 46:21]** and he sealed the wound with the Holy Spirit.

**[46:21 - 46:23]** But us in Jesus.

**[46:23 - 46:27]** And now if any man is in Christ,

**[46:27 - 46:29]** he is a new creature.

**[46:29 - 46:32]** And now we are one with the Lord.

**[46:32 - 46:34]** And now listen to me.

**[46:34 - 46:37]** Jesus himself by the Spirit of God

**[46:37 - 46:39]** is breathing for you.

**[46:39 - 46:40]** You need to understand.

**[46:40 - 46:43]** You are alive because Jesus is healing.

**[46:43 - 46:46]** You are alive because Jesus is exhaling.

**[46:46 - 46:49]** And all you have to do is let him.

**[46:49 - 46:51]** Are you hear me?

**[46:51 - 46:52]** He is inhaling.

**[46:52 - 46:53]** He is exhaling.

**[46:53 - 46:55]** He is breathing in.

**[46:55 - 46:56]** He is breathing out.

**[46:56 - 46:58]** And as long as he is breathing in

**[46:58 - 46:59]** and breathing out.

**[46:59 - 47:01]** And you are letting him breathe in

**[47:01 - 47:02]** and breathe out.

**[47:02 - 47:03]** You will grow.

**[47:03 - 47:05]** You will mature.

**[47:05 - 47:06]** You will develop.

**[47:06 - 47:08]** You will be perfected.

**[47:08 - 47:10]** And one day you will be fully

**[47:10 - 47:13]** totally completely conformed

**[47:13 - 47:16]** to the image of Jesus.

**[47:16 - 47:18]** Say hallelujah.

**[47:18 - 47:21]** One more time.

**[47:21 - 47:22]** Say hallelujah.

**[47:22 - 47:26]** Let our eyes open.

**[47:26 - 47:28]** Let us see it.

**[47:28 - 47:31]** Now let me come back

**[47:31 - 47:34]** and reinforce what I just said.

**[47:34 - 47:37]** Sin disconnected us.

**[47:37 - 47:40]** We were living apart from him

**[47:40 - 47:42]** and we could not

**[47:42 - 47:44]** on our own greed.

**[47:44 - 47:51]** God did something on the cross.

**[47:51 - 47:53]** And he repaired

**[47:53 - 47:57]** the spiritual umbilical cord.

**[47:57 - 47:59]** Whatever the system was,

**[47:59 - 48:01]** I am using the umbilical cord he has to metaphor.

**[48:01 - 48:04]** But whatever the spiritual system

**[48:04 - 48:06]** that God has established that allowed

**[48:06 - 48:09]** the life of Christ to enter us

**[48:09 - 48:12]** and for us to actually live

**[48:12 - 48:14]** back Christ's life.

**[48:14 - 48:16]** Whatever the system

**[48:16 - 48:18]** that God needed to put in place

**[48:18 - 48:21]** that allowed Christ to literally be breathing for us

**[48:21 - 48:24]** spiritually so that he keeps us alive.

**[48:24 - 48:27]** God did that on the cross.

**[48:27 - 48:29]** Henceforth,

**[48:29 - 48:32]** you are like that baby

**[48:32 - 48:37]** in the womb of Jesus.

**[48:37 - 48:41]** You are living by the power of His life.

**[48:41 - 48:44]** Say this life that I live.

**[48:44 - 48:48]** I live by the power of that life

**[48:48 - 48:52]** which is His life in me.

**[48:52 - 49:02]** Say this life,

**[49:02 - 49:06]** the Christian life that I live.

**[49:06 - 49:12]** I live daily by the power of that life

**[49:12 - 49:15]** which is His life in me.

**[49:15 - 49:24]** Those are facts.

**[49:24 - 49:27]** Words cannot fully explain

**[49:27 - 49:29]** no illustration is perfect.

**[49:29 - 49:32]** But here's the bottom line.

**[49:32 - 49:37]** Christ is indeed the life of the believer.

**[49:37 - 49:42]** And just like Mama breathes for the child

**[49:42 - 49:46]** and supplies the child with all of the nutrients

**[49:46 - 49:50]** the child needs to grow.

**[49:50 - 49:55]** Christ is breathing for you.

**[49:55 - 49:59]** His life is your breath.

**[49:59 - 50:03]** His life is your nutrients.

**[50:03 - 50:07]** His life is keeping you alive.

**[50:07 - 50:09]** I hear me.

**[50:09 - 50:17]** Now, what are you supposed to do about that?

**[50:17 - 50:21]** Code of Romans 6-11 because there are instructions

**[50:21 - 50:24]** and I'm going to have to move quickly here because of time.

**[50:24 - 50:26]** But that's Code of Romans 7.

**[50:26 - 50:28]** Now,

**[50:28 - 50:31]** if you notice before we got to Romans 6-11

**[50:31 - 50:33]** when I was reading the scripture,

**[50:33 - 50:36]** you kept hearing this word no.

**[50:36 - 50:38]** Know that our old man was crucified.

**[50:38 - 50:41]** Know this, know this, know this.

**[50:41 - 50:43]** Remember that?

**[50:43 - 50:45]** I think if you went to verse 6 by the time

**[50:45 - 50:46]** you don't have to go there.

**[50:46 - 50:48]** But over and over,

**[50:48 - 50:50]** he says,

**[50:50 - 50:54]** don't you know or knowing that your old man was crucified,

**[50:54 - 50:56]** knowing that you were buried with him,

**[50:56 - 50:58]** knowing that you were raised with him.

**[50:58 - 51:00]** Here it is.

**[51:00 - 51:06]** For this union and identification with Christ,

**[51:06 - 51:09]** this victory with Christ has won for you

**[51:09 - 51:12]** and which you want because you are in him.

**[51:12 - 51:15]** To now become part of your experience,

**[51:15 - 51:21]** first of all, you've got to know.

**[51:21 - 51:24]** Say the neighbor, you cannot afford to be ignorant.

**[51:24 - 51:27]** You cannot walk in this victory until you know

**[51:27 - 51:31]** you already have it.

**[51:31 - 51:33]** Where, how do you get to know it from the word?

**[51:33 - 51:39]** How do you get to know it by listening to this sermon 100 times?

**[51:39 - 51:42]** The point is, for you now to actually walk

**[51:42 - 51:44]** in the experience of victory,

**[51:44 - 51:46]** you have to do something.

**[51:46 - 51:49]** You've got to let it happen.

**[51:49 - 51:52]** And the first step in letting it happen

**[51:52 - 51:59]** is for you to know that you have been crucified with Christ.

**[51:59 - 52:02]** No, that you are dead to sin.

**[52:02 - 52:05]** No, that you are alive to God.

**[52:05 - 52:06]** Know it.

**[52:06 - 52:08]** Spend time in the word.

**[52:08 - 52:10]** Spend time meditating.

**[52:10 - 52:12]** Spend time listening.

**[52:12 - 52:13]** Write it down.

**[52:13 - 52:14]** Hear it.

**[52:14 - 52:15]** Over and over.

**[52:15 - 52:18]** But the first step to the victory

**[52:18 - 52:21]** is to know you have the victory.

**[52:21 - 52:24]** Because until you know you have the victory,

**[52:24 - 52:28]** you will let the one who is defeated still control you.

**[52:28 - 52:34]** Say it down with love for you to spend your time fighting him.

**[52:34 - 52:36]** Because as long as you are fighting him,

**[52:36 - 52:38]** you are not walking in victory.

**[52:38 - 52:43]** Did you hear me?

**[52:43 - 52:47]** He will love for you to fight him and fight him and fight him.

**[52:47 - 52:49]** Because as long as you are fighting him,

**[52:49 - 52:52]** you are not walking in the victory.

**[52:52 - 52:57]** Christ has already won.

**[52:57 - 53:00]** So one of his strategies now

**[53:00 - 53:02]** is to keep you ignorant.

**[53:02 - 53:04]** Jesus has already fallen.

**[53:04 - 53:06]** Jesus has this amazine.

**[53:06 - 53:08]** He has those who have been able to do it.

**[53:08 - 53:10]** But if he can keep you ignorant,

**[53:10 - 53:11]** he can treat you

**[53:11 - 53:13]** and get you to do what he wants you to do.

**[53:13 - 53:16]** He can oppress your mind, your will, your emotions,

**[53:16 - 53:17]** make you full of fear.

**[53:17 - 53:19]** He can do all of that

**[53:19 - 53:21]** as long as he can keep the truth from you

**[53:21 - 53:26]** that you know what this victory has already been won.

**[53:26 - 53:29]** So what's the first thing you're going to commit to church?

**[53:29 - 53:35]** Say, I commit to knowing.

**[53:35 - 53:36]** Amen?

**[53:36 - 53:41]** Know this.

**[53:41 - 53:43]** And then here's the second thing.

**[53:43 - 53:45]** He says you should do what?

**[53:45 - 53:47]** Recon, say Recon.

**[53:47 - 53:50]** Recon yourself to be what?

**[53:50 - 53:52]** Dead.

**[53:52 - 53:55]** And for emphasis, he said dead indeed.

**[53:55 - 53:57]** Oh my goodness.

**[53:57 - 54:02]** Say I'm dead indeed.

**[54:02 - 54:03]** And man, you know he's a man.

**[54:03 - 54:07]** That man is rich indeed.

**[54:07 - 54:09]** You know what that's known?

**[54:09 - 54:11]** That's known.

**[54:11 - 54:14]** When someone is rich indeed, they are rich.

**[54:14 - 54:19]** When someone is fine indeed, they are fine.

**[54:19 - 54:22]** And when someone is dead indeed, they are.

**[54:23 - 54:26]** Now, you would think that there are no degrees in death.

**[54:26 - 54:29]** But it seems like God wonder says there is dead

**[54:29 - 54:31]** and then there is real dead.

**[54:31 - 54:38]** And he's saying when it comes to sin, you are what?

**[54:38 - 54:40]** Some of you are not talking.

**[54:40 - 54:45]** When it comes to sin, say I am dead indeed.

**[54:45 - 54:52]** You say I don't feel that it's safe for you.

**[54:52 - 54:53]** That's a problem.

**[54:53 - 54:55]** We start trying to live out of our feelings

**[54:55 - 54:58]** and we make our feelings more truth than the word of God.

**[54:59 - 55:03]** Your feelings can lie to you.

**[55:03 - 55:08]** You can feel someone loves you and ain't love you.

**[55:08 - 55:11]** You can feel that this is the person God has said

**[55:11 - 55:13]** and this is the person you could have spent your whole life

**[55:13 - 55:18]** with and that person looking at someone else.

**[55:18 - 55:20]** Feelings lie all the time, right?

**[55:20 - 55:21]** You know that.

**[55:21 - 55:24]** How many times have your feelings that lie to you?

**[55:24 - 55:26]** You acted upon your feelings only to discover

**[55:26 - 55:29]** that your feelings were lying.

**[55:29 - 55:32]** My goodness, man, don't put your faith in feelings.

**[55:32 - 55:34]** Put your faith in the word of God.

**[55:34 - 55:36]** Don't put your faith in feelings.

**[55:36 - 55:39]** Put your faith in the one who can not lie.

**[55:39 - 55:42]** Put your faith in the one who said

**[55:42 - 55:46]** you are dead indeed to sin.

**[55:46 - 55:55]** So stop seeing yourself as alive to sin.

**[55:55 - 55:57]** And so the scripture says reckon.

**[55:57 - 56:00]** Not what reckon doesn't mean pretend.

**[56:00 - 56:03]** It doesn't mean pretend you are dead.

**[56:03 - 56:05]** It's an accounting term.

**[56:05 - 56:07]** It means this is a fact.

**[56:07 - 56:10]** So count on it.

**[56:10 - 56:12]** Recon it.

**[56:12 - 56:15]** Factor it in because nothing you do will change it.

**[56:15 - 56:19]** It's so.

**[56:19 - 56:20]** So you need to know.

**[56:20 - 56:24]** Then you need to say you know I'm not only do I know this.

**[56:24 - 56:27]** I am going to wreck it.

**[56:27 - 56:29]** It is so.

**[56:29 - 56:31]** I know what the word says.

**[56:31 - 56:32]** Not I reckon it.

**[56:32 - 56:35]** It is so for me.

**[56:35 - 56:41]** I'm not just dead to sit out and dead.

**[56:41 - 56:43]** Not what something is dead to something.

**[56:43 - 56:46]** And you say to me, be sure I'm dead to you.

**[56:46 - 56:50]** Or you're dead to me.

**[56:50 - 56:51]** Maybe that's a better.

**[56:51 - 56:52]** Be sure you're dead to me.

**[56:52 - 56:54]** What does that mean?

**[56:54 - 56:55]** And me as well.

**[56:55 - 56:56]** Don't go, sir.

**[56:56 - 56:58]** You and me got nothing in common.

**[56:58 - 57:00]** I don't care about you.

**[57:00 - 57:02]** I have no interest in you.

**[57:02 - 57:04]** We're not walking to you.

**[57:04 - 57:06]** In fact, I don't even want to see your face.

**[57:06 - 57:08]** And when I walk, I would just walk past you.

**[57:08 - 57:11]** Like you do not even exist.

**[57:11 - 57:13]** You are dead to me.

**[57:13 - 57:15]** Indeed.

**[57:15 - 57:21]** And man, as some of you know how to be dead to people.

**[57:21 - 57:25]** You know how to walk by people and act like they're not even there.

**[57:25 - 57:28]** You know how to withhold your speech from people.

**[57:28 - 57:31]** Because they did something as far as you concerned.

**[57:31 - 57:33]** That person is dead to me.

**[57:33 - 57:35]** They send you a WhatsApp message.

**[57:35 - 57:36]** You don't respond.

**[57:36 - 57:38]** They're dead to you.

**[57:38 - 57:40]** They have an apartheid invite you.

**[57:40 - 57:43]** You go, please, they're dead to you.

**[57:43 - 57:45]** People are talking good things about them.

**[57:45 - 57:48]** You walk away because they're dead to you.

**[57:48 - 57:50]** My goodness, you're dead.

**[57:50 - 57:53]** And that should be, look, sin and me.

**[57:53 - 57:55]** I'm dead to it.

**[57:55 - 57:59]** There's nothing in me that desires sin.

**[57:59 - 58:01]** He said, but what about all these feelings?

**[58:01 - 58:03]** You are not your feelings.

**[58:03 - 58:05]** You are a born-again child of God.

**[58:05 - 58:07]** Your spirit is born to Christ.

**[58:07 - 58:09]** The real you is your spirit.

**[58:09 - 58:16]** And your spirit has no appetite for sin at all.

**[58:16 - 58:18]** Those are the facts you need to know.

**[58:18 - 58:20]** But then you need to make the decision.

**[58:20 - 58:21]** This is how you let them.

**[58:21 - 58:23]** You don't have to struggle to do this.

**[58:23 - 58:24]** You don't have to fight.

**[58:24 - 58:25]** Who do you have to fight?

**[58:25 - 58:27]** It's just you making up your mind.

**[58:27 - 58:29]** You're going to reckon what God said.

**[58:29 - 58:33]** Let what God said be true to you.

**[58:33 - 58:42]** Say, I'm dead to sin.

**[58:42 - 58:44]** And if you're struggling to say that right now,

**[58:44 - 58:47]** you're the one who needs to say it more often.

**[58:47 - 58:51]** Until you really start believing it.

**[58:51 - 58:57]** Because you are in Christ.

**[58:57 - 58:59]** And Christ is dead to sin.

**[58:59 - 59:01]** What are you?

**[59:01 - 59:07]** And you are in Christ.

**[59:07 - 59:09]** And Christ is alive to God.

**[59:10 - 59:14]** What are you?

**[59:14 - 59:16]** That's your spiritual reality.

**[59:16 - 59:19]** Union identification.

**[59:19 - 59:22]** Go on next verse very quickly.

**[59:22 - 59:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[59:24 - 59:29]** Therefore do not do what?

**[59:29 - 59:35]** Do not let sin reign in your mantra about it that you should do what?

**[59:35 - 59:36]** So yes, the third thing.

**[59:36 - 59:37]** I know.

**[59:37 - 59:39]** Because I see the revelation.

**[59:39 - 59:41]** I reckon.

**[59:41 - 59:43]** Now I reckon it's a command.

**[59:43 - 59:45]** But it's not a command to do something.

**[59:45 - 59:48]** It's a command to believe something.

**[59:48 - 59:50]** It's a command that we need to obey.

**[59:50 - 59:53]** But the command does not go quite.

**[59:53 - 59:59]** But believe that you got peace with God.

**[59:59 - 01:00:00]** Believe you.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** You're selling the grace of God.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Believe in this whole.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** And believe your dead to say, believe it.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** And then he says, let not.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Do not let.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Here's the third thing.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:16]** I told you, Victor is really a matter of letting and letting not.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:23]** You let the truth that, of Christ, who is your life, the real to you.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:26]** You let that be true to you.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:37]** And then you make a decision to let not sin, rule or exercise any dominion over your life.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** You say, what bishop?

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]** Yeah, I'm saying the only way sin can grow over you or me is if we let it.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** You have to let sin.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** You have to give.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** You got to make it easy for sin to come in.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** Because the sin has to resist you.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** It's not going to enter.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** So let's turn around.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:03]** Instead of you resisting sin in the form of fighting against it.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** You resist sin by believing.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** By being steadfast in your faith.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:11]** The Bible says we fight the fighter faith.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Amen?

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** By being steadfast in your faith in believing what?

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** You are dead to sin.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** You are alive to God.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Are you going to leave?

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** And then you let not sin.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:30]** So when sin comes, it offers itself to you and promises you.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:33]** All you got to do is say no.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** Let it, don't let it happen.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:39]** No, no, I'm not going to let it happen.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Sorry.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:44]** You know, there was a time when you didn't have to power not to sin.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:49]** Now because you're dead to sin, you have to power not to sin.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** You just, you have to power not to yield to a daughter fornicate.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:57]** You simply need to know who you are, reckon it is so.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** Keep that in your mind and then make the decision when sin comes.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** No, I'm not letting you, no, I'm not letting you, no.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** No, no, no.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** No.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** No.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** No, I'm, say no.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:15]** No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not letting you tip me to commit adultery.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** No.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** That's, that's not who I am.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** I'm dead to you.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:30]** And you got, you got a, you got a minute time, you got to open your mouth and say it.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** Because faith works that way.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** You believe in your heart and you speak out of your mouth.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** You got to open your mouth.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** No, no, no.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** No, I'm not going to do it.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Why aren't you going to do it?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** I'm dead to sin.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** Why aren't you going to do it?

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** I'm alive to God.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:47]** And if that's your position, then you let not.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:53]** So the only way sin can really have to mean in over you is if you do not resist sin

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** and you just let it pass away.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** But how do you resist sin by believing?

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]** Say, I believe I'm dead to sin.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** I'm alive unto God.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:09]** The next time you attempt to commit fornication,

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:20]** which really ought to be the easiest thing you, you, you really shouldn't be that hard

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** because it takes a lot to commit fornication.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:28]** You got to plan it or you got to put yourself in.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** I mean, that just, it's not one of those things.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:34]** You know, sometimes you cuss and it's just coming on your mouth before you can think.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:40]** But fornication, sexual sin, you got to plan that thing.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:47]** If the first time the thoughts are coming to your mind, you just say, no, I'm not going to let you.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** You know, no, no.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** I'm dead to sin, I'm alive to go.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Amen.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** Christ is my life.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** I'm one with Him. No, no, no.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** I'm not going to let you have your, no.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:06]** I hear you. I see this zero better.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** Okay, everybody say let not.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:11]** Amen.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:16]** And hear me. Let me tell you this because when you understand that Christ is your life,

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:22]** then this is how you can receive strength to let not.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:29]** You can say the life of Christ in me empowers me to say no to sin.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:34]** Therefore, I let not.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** Christ is my life and He's empowering me to live holy.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** Therefore, I will let not.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:47]** You see, now you're placing your faith in Christ in you for the ability to resist.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:51]** All right, and then lastly, go on to the next verse.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** And then we have to conclude.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** And do what?

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:59]** Do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** But do what?

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:04]** Present yourselves to God as what?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:08]** Being alive from the dead and your members.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** So what do you do?

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** Again, there are certain things you have to do.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** One, you have to know two, you have to reckon three, you have to decide to let not.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** Amen?

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:20]** And then thirdly and then fourthly, let.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:24]** So there are some things you let not, and then there's something you let.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** And what do you do?

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:30]** You let your members become an instrument of righteousness to God.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]** And how do you let your members become an instrument of righteousness?

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** You present your bodies to Him.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** Every day, let that be part of your prayer.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:43]** Lord, this day I present my body to you to be an instrument for righteousness.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:48]** I let you live your life through me the day, Christ.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:53]** And bear your fruit in me and through me in Jesus' name.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** So let's repeat.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Say, I am crucified with Christ.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:00]** I am dead with sin.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:03]** I am alive to God.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]** I have His light, His nature, and His ability.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** Working in me all the time.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** He's breathing in for me.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:16]** He's exhaling out for me.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:25]** And I am growing, maturing, being transformed into a perfect man, conform to the image of Jesus.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Thank you Lord.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:31]** This is my reality.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:34]** In Jesus' name.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** In Jesus' name.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** In Jesus' name?

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:43]** Now, here's my altar call.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** Here's my altar call.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:57]** Go back and listen to this message and listen to the one before and the one before and the one before.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:04]** Listen and listen and listen until you understand it and you can preach it better than I can.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:07]** Now I think I did a pretty good job.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:16]** So for you to preach it better, and I know you can, but you're going to have to put some effort into grasping it in Jesus.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:24]** But seriously, you need to review, remind, go over this until you truly grasp it in Jesus' name.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Amen.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Father, thank you for today.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:29]** Thank you for the ministry of your word and the ministry of your spirit.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:34]** We believe, O God, that you have done something in our hearts and our lives and that this revelation, this truth,

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:47]** that we have received today will take root and it will produce fruit that will change us in Jesus' name and conform us to the image of Christ.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:57]** From now on, don't fight for victory over sin, over Satan or over self.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:12]** From now on, stand in a victory that Christ has won and let that victory manifest in your life by believing it and speaking it and declaring it, and renewing your mind with it.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:17]** If you do that, it will manifest in your life.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:21]** In Jesus' name. Amen.

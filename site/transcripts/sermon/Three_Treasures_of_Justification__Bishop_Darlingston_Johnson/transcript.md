Let's go to the word, go back to Romans chapter 5, we are taking time to remind you and refocus you and reground you in the foundations of the faith. I am concerned more and more as I travel, that there are so many people who confess to be Christians, believe they are Christians in, quote unquote, Christian churches and have never heard the gospel because one has been preached to them has not been the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. They've heard a lot of things that they're supposed to do. They've heard the name of Jesus mentioned, but the gospel of the grace of God, which is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the only gospel that is the power of God ought to salvation, many are not hearing it. And because they're not hearing it, they have no confidence of their salvation. They have no confidence of each other's life. And some of them have never, ever really received Jesus as Savior and Lord because the gospel itself has never been presented to them. So I want to focus on this and I'm going to stay there until the Lord tells me to do that's something else, but we're in the book of rumors right now. And so let's go to rumors chapter five, we're going to read from verse one to five. And then I'm going to speak to you on what I call to do, the treasures or the three treasures of justification. Let's read together, therefore, haven't been justified by faith. We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also glory or rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope. And I hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, amen. So I want to speak today on what I call the three treasures of justification. Let me remind you again of what it means to be justified before God. To be justified before God is to be declared righteous or right in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of God. And for that reason, to be set free from all punishment for your sins, both now and forever. Let me repeat that. To be justified is to be declared righteous or right before the law and before God. And therefore, because you have been declared righteous or right in the eyes of the law and before God, you have therefore been set free from all punishment from the wrath of God that you were under before Jesus Christ died for you. That's the gospel. Men struggle to believe it because religion says it cannot be that easy. There has to be works. And many people struggle with that and as a result, never receive Christ truly as their savior because they insist it has to also be to some degree by their works. The city and neighbor, if you are in Christ, you have been declared righteous, right before the law. In other words, the law itself has declared you now right. I know what you're going to say, God, it is God, but I want to focus on the fact that the reason God has declared you right is because the law has been satisfied. And the law itself says to the man who has won guilty, condemn and go to hell, has for you are right in my eyes, amen? So that declaration of justification frees us from the condemnation of the law, frees us from all future judgment, frees us from God's wrath. And this declaration is a legal declaration. In other words, God made this on the basis of following the law to the tea. I told you last week, it's not an emotion of the God is motivated by love, it is the love of God that motivated him to do this. But in doing that, God followed the law to the tea. He fulfilled all the requirements that the law demanded, are you hear me? That sinners must fulfill and the law sentence sinners to what the law says without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sins. So God cannot simply forgive men simply because he loves them, the law must be satisfied and there must be the shedding of blood. That is what the law demands. Now, it can be the blood of the guilty person or it can be the blood of an accepted substitute. But death is the trust penalty, it's what justice demands. When we who are human beings rebel against a holy, just and good God, justice according to the law requires death. And the law doesn't bend, the law does not bend for anybody. So respectfully, I'm saying this, so it didn't even bend for God. I'm saying this respectfully, I want you to understand God is the one who established the law also, but I want you to understand that even the one who established the law who is really greater than the law, himself submitted to the law. The law didn't say since your God and you love them and you want to forgive them, let's just forgive them. It didn't bend for God. God didn't want it to bend for him because the law is just the law, his holy, God is holy. So God himself submitted to the law, you hear me? That's why God had to send the sun, that's why Jesus had to become men, so that he can die in order to fulfill the law. The good news is he has died and he has fulfilled the law and therefore the law itself now accepts the fact that he has fulfilled it and therefore releases all of us. Say hallelujah, so this verdict of not guilty, which is being declared right just before God, being justified before God, is a verdict that has been issued by the law itself because it is satisfied. Hallelujah, Nibbasa, if you are in Christ, you are legally released from your guilt, from the wrath of God, from divine punishment because of sin, you are legally released from the law. Therefore, you have no further obligations to the law. Scripture says you have died to the law. Why do you have no further obligations to the law because all the obligations you had to the law have been fulfilled by Jesus on your behalf? Again, nothing is simple being overlooked. Everything is being done by Jesus. That's why you should celebrate Jesus and that's why Jesus could say, I'm the way. I'm the truth. Nobody can come to the Father and say, nobody, nobody, that's why every other religion leads nowhere because Muhammad could not die. For your sins, he had his own, Confucius couldn't do it. None of these quote-unquote people could do it because it did die for yours who were died for theirs. But Jesus could, come on, say Jesus could, say Jesus could, say Hallelujah, amen, why could Jesus die because he's the only one born of a virgin, came into the world with us sin and lived for 33 years a perfect light of faith and obedience satisfying the law in every way the law could find nothing to charge him with. And therefore the law could accept his death as a substitute for ours. Raise your hand. The whole world needs to hear about Jesus. More religions are not the same. It's not about loving everybody, it's not about being good. Your goodness before God is as filth or rags. That's what the Scripture says. Say, Hallelujah, amen. Now you keep in mind now that everything Jesus did while he was on earth was done to accomplish this goal of securing a verdict of not guilty for us. And here I mean, he wanted to make sure that this verdict would be everlasting. In other words, there's nothing that we could do that would reverse it. He didn't come to die so that we can reverse what he did. Then he should have said, he wasted his blood. If Jesus wasted his blood, if after going through all that he did, the verdict of not guilty can simply be reversed when you sin because I got news for you. You still sin. So if every job you sin, if the verdict depends upon you living perfectly, Jesus you died in vain. Here's a good news. You couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. We couldn't do it. Jesus could. And Jesus did for us. Say, Hallelujah. All the charges that were against us have been dropped. And they can never be brought back due to some future failure. This is why the Bible says that I sinned and iniquities I will remember who is God speaking to. He's speaking to all of those who believe in the sun. He's not speaking to those who are not in Christ, those who have not received them. They're sins and iniquities God remembers every day. And they are facing the wrath of God. The Bible says the wrath of God is upon them. But thank God. One day you hurt the gospel. That's why the whole world needs to hear the gospel. That's why your parents need to hear, your children need to hear it, your neighbors need to hear it, your coworkers need to hear it. The whole world needs to hear the gospel. Because one day you heard the good news that Jesus paid for the sins of the whole world. And if you will receive Jesus as your Savior and Lord, then the penalty of your sins are paid for by the blood of Jesus and you get released. Those who reject Christ will continue to abide under the wrath of God. That's why we got to win the Lord's Word. That's why we got to trust God and do all that we care with His power to get this gospel out here in the area that we're living in and across the ocean in those nations. Because unless they hear the gospel, they cannot believe it. And if they don't believe it, they cannot be saved. Okay. Say, say, say this justification, this declaration of righteousness is everlasting. It's important for you to understand that because the everlasting nature of this declaration is what makes the new covenant better than the old. The problem with the old was every year they had to keep offering sacrifices over and over and over and over. And Jesus says in John, in Hebrews chapter 10, he says, sacrifice an offering's God, you are not pleased with it. Why was God not pleased? Because all of those sacrifices did not achieve God's purpose. Men were still guilty, men were still condemned. The blood sacrifice is never set all the sin problem for God, nor for us. So God was not pleased with it again. If you go to a doctor and the doctor keep giving you some injection every time you go, he sticks you, every time he goes, he sticks you, but the problem is not getting better. The problem is there. Will you still want to be stuck? Come on. What are you giving me is insulting the problem? Give me something that works. And basically that was what was happening. The blood of goats and animal sacrifices didn't solve the sin problem. God was pleased with God. I need something better. Jesus said, let me go and let me offer, men, the sacrifice, the sacrifice, let me present the blood that asked the power once and for all to set all the sin problem. Get these people delivered from the judgment and condemnation they were under and you can then declare that verdict of not guilty and it will stay. So hear me, it is the everlasting nature of the work that Jesus did that makes the new covenant better than the old that makes the blood of Jesus a better sacrifice. It is this everlasting nature that makes the priesthood of Jesus greater than that of Aaron and makes it an everlasting priest to somebody say, hallelujah, here is how Hebrews 10, 14 percent for by one offering, he has perfected for ever those who are being sanctified. So all of us who are being sent apart unto God sanctified, all of us who are being sent apart unto God throughout faith in Jesus Christ, Jesus is one offering has perfected you forever. Raise your hand and say thank you Jesus, I am justified declares legally rights by the law in the eyes of the law. Therefore, the law has released you legally from itself, that's why Paul says you're no longer under the law. Are you hearing me? All right well let me answer the second question. You're justified but the Bible says you're justified by faith. You're justified by faith. What does that mean? It means that what Jesus has accomplished by his death, this verdict of not guilty, this being right before God. What Jesus accomplished all that cross which has provided forgiveness of sins that is equal to, all the sins of every man who ever lived or will ever live. All of that the blood of Jesus is sufficient to secure forgiveness for. Okay, that is a fact. And a man who wants to be saved right now can be saved. The blood of Jesus, I don't know how many people are living, but their billions today, if they become trillions, it doesn't matter. The value of the blood of Jesus is enough to cover the sin of every man, every woman, every born girl. So the potential for every human being to be delivered from wrath and hell is unlimited because of our Christ did. Nevertheless, no one can be saved. That forgiveness cannot take effect until an individual personally receives Jesus Christ as savior and law. You hear me? There is no such thing as universal salvation and some teach that because Christ died and because His blood was shed for everybody and because the blood paid the price for all our sins. Therefore, everybody is saved and everybody is going to heaven. That's not true. Because the Bible says here, you justify, it becomes yours through faith. Faith is essential for the receiving of this justification as available to everybody. I bet here's what the Bible says. The Bible says, by one man, Adam, sin enter into the world, by one man, it all became sinners, by the disobedience of one man, all became sinners. But it didn't stop there. It says not likewise through the obedience of one man, Jesus Christ, many shall be made righteous. Not all. Because all of those who actually placed their faith in Jesus as savior and law will actually experience partake of and benefit from His atoning work on the cross. So my question is, have you actually received Jesus as your savior and as your law? I didn't say do you come to church? I didn't say do you believe in God? I didn't say do you believe you need to be good? I didn't say do you need to keep the commandments? None of those things will save you. All of them are fine. None of them will save you. Here's what will save you. You personally individually placing your faith in Jesus Christ and the blood that He shed on cavalry as being sufficient to secure the forgiveness of all your sins and to make you right before God. Do you believe that? If you believe it say amen. If you believe it say hallelujah, if you are trusting in Jesus as your savior and trusting in His work on the cross as the only basis for your salvation, raise your hand and say thank you Jesus. Now, if you are trusting in yourself or putting confidence in yourself or in your church or in your vegetable, in your religion and not in Christ and Christ alone, you have not yet received nor appropriated this salvation that Christ has purchased for you. Let nobody leave here today without personally individually knowing that you have received Jesus as your savior and you have received the salvation as a gift. I hear me. No one can earn it. The Bible says there's none righteous. No, not one. So none can receive it, but all can receive it by faith if they realize it's a gift. And what is this gift? It is the gift of God's own righteousness. That's what God has given you and me. His own righteousness, not yours, but his own. You stand right now as righteous as God himself. You stand right now as righteous as Jesus. Bishop has blasphemy. No, it's a gift. I didn't say you earned it. I didn't say you achieved it. I'm telling you you can't. I'm telling you your own works are filter racks. I'm saying you can never achieve it. No matter how good you are. But if you have humbled yourself and received Jesus as your savior, this is what God has given you. His own righteousness. In fact, the Bible says you have received the very righteousness of God. He's made you that. Say he has made me as a gift of grace, motivated by his love. He has made me through Jesus Christ, the righteousness of God. That should be your mindset. When you go to God, you ought to be saying the righteousness of God is here, Father. That's becoming righteous as conscious as acting on what Christ said. Come and say the righteousness of God is here this morning, Father. How are you? When you deal with the devil, say the righteousness of God, just spoke to you. You go to God to the righteousness of God. When you're facing challenges, you're no match for the righteousness of God. I'm not afraid of you. Amen? When I tell you there are witches in the village, don't go to the village because witches in the village say, I am the righteousness of God in Christ. And the powers of darkness have no power over me. Say hallelujah. They tell you that they have formed weapons against you. You say no. Who have formed against me can prosper. You don't have to go and go for the days and go and see the prophet and come to somebody's altar and ask the men of God to pray for you and lose your sleep. All about is because you don't know what God has given you freely by grace. You don't understand what it means to be declared not guilty. You don't know what it means to be the very righteousness of God in Christ. The Bible says, a factor of fervent prayer of the righteous man. You are that righteous man. In Christ, say in Christ, I am that righteous man who's praise and his prayers are powerful because the righteous cry, the Lord hears him. People all of this is the doing of Jesus Christ. I said all of this mind what a savior. That's why it should be Jesus in the morning, Jesus at noon day. Jesus all through the day. Amen because he is the answer. He is the solution. Are you hear me? He's the one that has changed your life. He has changed your past. He has changed your present. And he will definitely change your future. Say hallelujah. Everybody says thank God for Jesus. Amen. Amen. Now hear me. The only way to be justified is to receive Jesus Christ and the gift of righteousness. Are you hear me? And it's unmarried. It's unearned. And it's undeserved. Never try to earn righteousness. When you try to do that, you forbid it. The thing that would disqualify you for salvation is you trying to earn salvation. Are you hear me? Because the minute you decide you're going to try to merit an earning work for it, you have an SS denied the sufficient of the blood. So you got to receive the hall as a gift without working for it. Now it takes faith to do that. And that's why a lot of people don't ever receive it. Because it takes faith to believe in me, me, with all that I know about me, that by faith in Jesus Christ and His work alone has secured righteousness and salvation for me, the Jews struggle with that. Why? They were religious. And religious people believe in law. And so for the gospel, the Paul preach to be to declare that salvation is not based upon works for by grace that you say through faith. And that not of yourselves, it is a gift of God and not of works which we have nothing to do with keeping the law. Is this a gift? The Jewish people who are very religious, who believe so much in the commandments as the way of salvation, could not believe that. And that was why many of them rejected Paul and eventually killed him because they wanted to hear the law. Well, that hasn't changed. Religious people and many of them are in our churches. Some of them are here today. You know, your intention is good, but you're just wrong because you don't understand the gospel. Are you still here? The Jewish people could not. The Bible says, to the Jew Paul said this message of the grace of God, this message of salvation by grace alone, by faith alone in Christ alone, it was a stumbling block. Yes, that's it. When they got there, I said, no, that's too much. No, no, no, it can't be true. And this is happening in many Christian chronical churches. I said, many of you say that it's a stumbling block because they might know. It cannot be. How God will save you like that. That's the gospel. And it takes faith. And if you can believe it, the Greeks, who like wisdom said, that's foolishness. And so I don't know whether you agree today or Jew, but those of us who believe, oh, the possible answer, this gospel of Jesus Christ is what? The power of God that produces salvation. One more time. Say, thank God for his grace and for salvation through the blood of Jesus. I believe. Amen. Now, there's some, there's some who want to receive Him simply as Savior, because what they want is to be delivered from the penalty of sin. And there are some folks who preach grace. They call it free grace. They got all different kinds of grace, but there's the free grace theology that says, all you got to do is pray the sinner's prayer. All you got to do is simply exercise your faith once I exercise into your heart and how you live doesn't matter. As you can receive him as Savior, you don't have to receive him as Lord. It's in your interest to receive him as Lord. But you can be saved everlasting. So by simply believing in what he did on the cross. So you can receive the Savior because you want to be delivered from the penalty of sin which is hell. I don't believe that one bit because Jesus came to save us from sin, not to save us from hell. Thank God we get saved from hell, but hell is not the real evil, the real evil is sin. I hear me. It was sin that brought about the fall. It was sin that caused all the problems. It is sin that is a rebellion against God. The problem is sin. I hear me. And Jesus came to save from sin not just from the consequence of sin or the punishment of sin. He does that, but fundamentally he came to save us from what? Sin. And so believing on him and receiving him is receiving him as Savior and Lord. As Savior who will deliver you from the penalty of sin and as Lord who will deliver you from the power of sin. You see as Savior he delivers you from the wrath of God that is to come. As Lord he breaks the power of sin and he works in you and causes you both to will and do the things that please him. So you must trust sin to deliver you from the penalty of sin, but trust sin just as much to deliver you from the power of sin. Don't go about God. I know he would deliver me from the penalty of sin, but when it comes to the power of sin I have to do it myself. You follow me? He came to deliver you from the power of sin. And what he did on the cross, ladies and gentlemen, deliver you from the penalty and also from the power. That's what the Bible means when it says you were crucified with him. So on the cross, and I would have another sermon for this, on the cross Jesus dealt with the punishment of sin, but he also dealt with a sinner. It's like you want to stop people from smoking. And so you go and you pass a law of no smoking, and you collect all the cigarettes, but you need the cigarette factory. Do you think you were able to achieve a situation where there's no smoking? No, no. In fact, you don't have to worry about the cigarettes dealing with the factory. And if there are no cigarettes, whether they like it or not, there will be no smoking. God is not a fool. The plan, the plan of salvation was never just to take away sins of the penalty. God was going after sin itself. And that is why on the cross, God didn't want to deal with your sins. He dealt with a sinner. And so when we get to Romans 6, 1, 4, I would say, don't you know you are dead to sin? That sinner is dead. You have a new nature. Hallelujah. And so the trust for me, sir, will take place in you as you trust him as savior and Lord. Are you hear me? Learn to say, Jesus, you are my savior. Who has the liberty from the penalty of sin? Because you shared your blood. There's no health for me because you shared your blood. There's no wrath of God waiting me. Hallelujah. Thank you for your grace. And I love you. Amen. But Jesus, thank you. That you didn't want to deal with my, with my, with my sins, you dealt with me, the sinner. On the cross, you put that old man to death. You made me a new creature. And thank you, Jesus. You are working. Jesus, you are working in me right now every day. You're changing me. You're transforming me. Jesus, I trust you. I'm struggling here, but I trust you for the deliverance. I start, I'm struggling here, but I'm trusting you for the victory because you are my Lord. Sin will not have the meaning over me because you are my Lord. Sin cannot rule over me because you have already overcome sin for me. You follow me. I trust you. So you place your faith in the Savior to knowing he has delivered you from the penalty of sin. You place your faith to the Lord knowing that he has broken the power of sin and is exercising dominion over sin in you. But I think you got to believe because these things become experiential as you believe it. Is this gospel good or not? How long have you been preaching? I got 13 whole moments, 13 more minutes, great. Alright, so now that's that I've gone over being justified and being justified by faith, right? Now, here are the three treasures that are the result of being justified by faith. He says, being justified by faith, we have what? Peace with God. We have what? What do you have right now with God? What do you have? What is the state of your relationship with God? Is it one of racked or one of peace? Really? You really believe that? Amen. Amen. So we have peace with God. And that means we are totally completely reconciled. God is completely reconciled to us. There's nothing in God's heart or in his mind that he's holding against you. I know some of you are waiting for answers to prayer and the devil is telling you that because of this, something you did years ago. I mean, I think Pastor Obi was in, it was in Virginia, at the church there, when a lady who had been with you for a long time and who had been a Christian for a long time, I was there that day and she was sharing how she had done something. I don't know what it was, but was something her past. Even though this lady had been in church for so long, this thing that she had done in her past, she was convinced was blocking her blessing that God was holding against her, et cetera. I said, someone here, that's how you feel. You still feel there's something you did in your past. God is still holding against you today. And for that reason, God will not bless you. God will not hear your prayer. But let me be the mouth of God for you today. As far as God is concerned, he has nothing against you. I have nothing against you. Right? Now, if Papa can do things I do, he will miss the kind of fellowship communion and whatever benefits I blessing I could be to him, he will miss it because he thinks I have something against him. This is what spiritual warfare is principle above. They devilized us and pushed us in bondage. The essence of know the truth. Jesus said when you know the truth, the truth will set you free. And here is the truth because of Jesus. And it's only because of Jesus. I want you to understand this. It has nothing to do with you. But because of Jesus's love and the work he did on the cross right now. As far as God is concerned, there is peace. That means the war has ended. God is not dropping bombs. There is no curse. That is upon you now because God has cursed you. Christ redeemed us from the curse. That means he bought our freedom from the curse. If Christ's blood purchased my liberty from the curse, why would I accept some theology? That says that I am curse. Oh God, Jesus living in me. I live in Jesus. Blood of Jesus shared from me. And you tell me I'm curse. If what Christ did on the cross, did not break the curse. 40 days of prayer fasting will not break it. Amen. Giving one million dollars in the offering will not break it. You're going to have better reasons for praying and better reasons for giving than believing the lie of the devil. Say Christ has set me free. And now I have peace with God. So let me break it down. It means the end of hostilities, the nullification of all judgment, the cancellation of all debts, the removal of all legal and relational barriers. None. God no longer sees or treats you as an enemy. Things that once had the power to separate you from God no longer can separate you from God for the man who is in Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. But it doesn't want to mean those negative things are gone. It means there is the presence of good will. Peace with God means that he has granted you the status of sons, not mere servants or sinners. It means he is actively and he is forcefully for you. Not possibly. He is actively and forcefully. No, you didn't say I said say forcefully. Say forcefully for you. He's not just sitting and waiting and for things to happen. He's actively forcefully making things work for you. Actively forcefully resisting your enemies. Actively forcefully making everything work together. Hallelujah. Means that he's that constant friend that is sticking closer to you than a brother. It means he will never leave you on your own. It means he was with all no good thing from you. It means he loves you just as much as he loves Jesus. It means he will hear your prayer just like he hears Jesus is prayer. This is so yeah. Why? Because he loves you. Don't let the devil steal. Don't let the devil steal that reality from you. In this world we will have tribulation. Hear me. God has made peace with you. The devil has not. So you need to know when trouble comes. Where is coming from? I hear me. So Jesus says look don't worry. He says in this world you will have tribulation for a bit of good share. I have overcome the word meaning. I'm for you. Between God and you there's peace no war. You and the devil. You and this world are still at war. But he has a good thing because you have peace with God. You now have access which is the next treasure. So this grace in which you stand. I hear me. And this grace in which you stand gives you the power to rule and reign in life. So even though you will and you must and you will continue to deal with tribulation and trials and suffering because there is an enemy and you are still living in a fallen world. So it's good to know that God is not the one fighting against me. It's good to know like the Apostle said if God be on my side who shall be against me. So the revelation of Hallelujah that I have peace with God and therefore I now stand in the grace of God having access to the grace of God. Empowers me in the time of tribulation to go through the tribulation face the enemy not be overcome by him. So I'm standing in the grace of God. So I have peace with God. I'm justified and as a result I am standing living, walking, abiding in the unmerited and undeserved favor of God. I go to sleep enjoying unmerited favor. I wake up to unmerited favor. I go to work in unmerited favor. Everywhere I am I live in, I abiding, I swim in, I know nothing but unmerited and undeserved favor in Christ Jesus. I didn't get to ex-found on the second treasure fully grace and I didn't touch the third treasure hope. We're going to do that in subsequent messages but for now I just want you to know this. You have peace with God because you're justified. You have peace with God. You stand in the grace of God and you have hope. That peace is important. I don't know if they have done a scientific study to prove my point but whether they did or not I'm right. Amen. The truth is I believe in all my heart that the number one reason why people have to receive a goal looking for therapy is because of loss of hope. That hope is at the root. It's not all the great majority of the problems. We have sadness, depression, discouragement, loss of motivation, giving up. Amen. If you trace it, most of those emotions are psychological states that sometimes they become physical. The root is at some point somebody lost hope. So when Baba says three things faith, hope and love, faith is important, love is important but guys hope is extremely important. And I found that there are many Christians who ought to be enjoying the hope that is the results of being justified by faith having peace with God. Being able access to the grace of God, they should be always hopeful. Many lose their hope and then experience their effects of hopelessness. That doesn't need to happen if we are rooted and grounded in the hope that Paul speaks of here. Hope is important and there are many different things we hope for and it's good to have hope. Hope that you one day you get married. There's a person that is best for you. Hope that you one day you own your business. Hope is important because when you don't have hope there's no motivation, right? But none of those earthly hopes should be the anchor for your soul. Because here's the fact Paul says hope doesn't disappoint. He was talking about the hope that comes from God. They are upon the work of Jesus Christ. That hope we should talk about is what you anchor your soul because that one would not disappoint. The reality is all the other hopes can and sometimes do disappoint. And if you anchor your soul to them, you set yourself up for discouragement, despair, loss of motivation, backsliding, all of those things in Jesus' name. Say, Father, thank you today that because of Jesus I am justified declared righteous in your sight that I have peace ever lasting peace that can never be taken away from me in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. I thank you Lord that I stand, I live, I walk, I abide in this realm of unmerited grace and favor in the mighty name of Jesus. And last, Father, I thank you for the hope that is the anchor of my soul that is rooted in this peace I have with you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. So in subsequent messages, we will explore more that subject of hope. Hallelujah. In Jesus' name, yeah, send up and give God some praise. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ is Savior and Lord. Amen. Keep reminding yourself every day that God treats you as though you have never once broken any commandment in Christ because Jesus broke no commandment for you. And then remember that he treats you as though you have always obeyed him perfectly. Why? Because Jesus obeyed him perfectly for you. One more time, Jesus, I love you. Amen. God bless you now. If you're here today and you have not truly received Jesus as your Savior, you haven't. Really got to that point in your life where you realize your sinner, you couldn't save yourself, you realize you're bound by sin, you couldn't deliver yourself. And you needed a Savior, you needed help, you turned to the only one who could help you pardon your sins as your Savior and break the power of sin over your life as the Lord. If you have never done that, please do it today. Amen. If you are one of those who have received Christ, but you have not embraced for it what you have, you have continued to think wrong thoughts based upon false doctrine of emotions. Take the time to listen to these messages enough to change and transform your thinking so you can walk in the experience that God has made possible even in this world where there is tribulation. Do you hear me, church? I'm going to ask you to be seated and ask the elders, the pastors to come. We're going to give some time for prayer. We're going to take just a few minutes. So if you need prayer, we want you to come quickly. Hallelujah. If you need, if you want to receive Jesus, you can come at this point. If you say, listen, I really have backslid and I want to just get reconnected to the things of God so I can start growing again. Come. If you have a physical spiritual need, a family need, come. We're going to take a few minutes to pray for you. We have some words of knowledge. Do you have anything concerning healing? Nothing. Okay. Okay. How are you doing, Prescott? I have a word of knowledge concerning pain from your neck all the way down on your shoulder and then also pain on this side. If that's you, God wants to heal you. If you can stand, God wants to bless. So what you can do is just come to pass the OBE. If that's you, he will pray for you. Quickly, quickly. Come. Go ahead. You go ahead and say it quickly. The rest of you, you can start coming. You can start coming for prayer. You can start coming for prayer. I had a couple of words of knowledge. Somebody with a sharp pen in your left knee, receive your healing if that is you. I mean, come for prayer. Somebody with a pen on your left eye, there's pressure on that eye. Also, there's healing available here for you. And if you have been on your Thai, you don't receive your healing, there's also somebody with an issue, something with your truth. If it's like you even lost your voice because of the pain, pain on your throat, the Lord is healing you tonight and restoring your voice, pain on your shoulder. And the pain on your shoulder goes to your back and it's on the right side of your back. So if that's you, come for prayer. So if you are experiencing any of those things, come and receive prayer but don't limit that, if you need prayer for any area right now, come and let the pastors elders pray for you. There's also another one, be sure. Healing for chest tightness and chest pain, wrist, pain, anxiety, depression, fear. If you need of those things, come and thank Jesus. As we're praying when I ask the prayer, they pray seem to just softly lead us in.


## Detailed Transcript with Timestamps

**[Unknown - 00:10]** Let's go to the word, go back to Romans chapter 5, we are taking time to remind you and

**[00:10 - 00:17]** refocus you and reground you in the foundations of the faith.

**[00:17 - 00:24]** I am concerned more and more as I travel, that there are so many people who confess to

**[00:24 - 00:28]** be Christians, believe they are Christians in, quote unquote, Christian churches and have

**[00:28 - 00:33]** never heard the gospel because one has been preached to them has not been the gospel

**[00:33 - 00:35]** of the Lord Jesus Christ.

**[00:35 - 00:36]** Amen.

**[00:36 - 00:41]** They've heard a lot of things that they're supposed to do.

**[00:41 - 00:47]** They've heard the name of Jesus mentioned, but the gospel of the grace of God, which

**[00:47 - 00:53]** is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the only gospel that is the power of God ought to

**[00:53 - 00:58]** salvation, many are not hearing it.

**[00:58 - 01:02]** And because they're not hearing it, they have no confidence of their salvation.

**[01:02 - 01:06]** They have no confidence of each other's life.

**[01:06 - 01:12]** And some of them have never, ever really received Jesus as Savior and Lord because the

**[01:12 - 01:15]** gospel itself has never been presented to them.

**[01:15 - 01:19]** So I want to focus on this and I'm going to stay there until the Lord tells me to do

**[01:19 - 01:23]** that's something else, but we're in the book of rumors right now.

**[01:23 - 01:28]** And so let's go to rumors chapter five, we're going to read from verse one to five.

**[01:28 - 01:32]** And then I'm going to speak to you on what I call to do, the treasures or the three treasures

**[01:32 - 01:33]** of justification.

**[01:33 - 01:40]** Let's read together, therefore, haven't been justified by faith.

**[01:40 - 01:49]** We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom also we have access by

**[01:49 - 02:00]** faith into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

**[02:00 - 02:08]** And not only that, but we also glory or rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation

**[02:08 - 02:16]** produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope.

**[02:16 - 02:23]** And I hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts

**[02:23 - 02:27]** by the Holy Spirit, amen.

**[02:27 - 02:34]** So I want to speak today on what I call the three treasures of justification.

**[02:34 - 02:44]** Let me remind you again of what it means to be justified before God.

**[02:44 - 02:57]** To be justified before God is to be declared righteous or right in the eyes of the law

**[02:57 - 03:01]** and in the eyes of God.

**[03:01 - 03:18]** And for that reason, to be set free from all punishment for your sins, both now and forever.

**[03:18 - 03:20]** Let me repeat that.

**[03:20 - 03:34]** To be justified is to be declared righteous or right before the law and before God.

**[03:34 - 03:41]** And therefore, because you have been declared righteous or right in the eyes of the law

**[03:41 - 03:52]** and before God, you have therefore been set free from all punishment from the wrath of God

**[03:52 - 04:01]** that you were under before Jesus Christ died for you.

**[04:01 - 04:03]** That's the gospel.

**[04:03 - 04:15]** Men struggle to believe it because religion says it cannot be that easy.

**[04:15 - 04:19]** There has to be works.

**[04:19 - 04:27]** And many people struggle with that and as a result, never receive Christ truly as their savior

**[04:27 - 04:36]** because they insist it has to also be to some degree by their works.

**[04:36 - 04:47]** The city and neighbor, if you are in Christ, you have been declared righteous, right before

**[04:47 - 04:50]** the law.

**[04:50 - 04:55]** In other words, the law itself has declared you now right.

**[04:55 - 05:01]** I know what you're going to say, God, it is God, but I want to focus on the fact that the

**[05:01 - 05:09]** reason God has declared you right is because the law has been satisfied.

**[05:09 - 05:16]** And the law itself says to the man who has won guilty, condemn and go to hell, has for

**[05:16 - 05:23]** you are right in my eyes, amen?

**[05:23 - 05:31]** So that declaration of justification frees us from the condemnation of the law, frees

**[05:31 - 05:38]** us from all future judgment, frees us from God's wrath.

**[05:38 - 05:42]** And this declaration is a legal declaration.

**[05:42 - 05:53]** In other words, God made this on the basis of following the law to the tea.

**[05:53 - 05:59]** I told you last week, it's not an emotion of the God is motivated by love, it is the love

**[05:59 - 06:01]** of God that motivated him to do this.

**[06:01 - 06:05]** But in doing that, God followed the law to the tea.

**[06:05 - 06:12]** He fulfilled all the requirements that the law demanded, are you hear me?

**[06:12 - 06:22]** That sinners must fulfill and the law sentence sinners to what the law says without the shedding

**[06:22 - 06:25]** of blood, there can be no remission of sins.

**[06:25 - 06:33]** So God cannot simply forgive men simply because he loves them, the law must be satisfied and

**[06:33 - 06:36]** there must be the shedding of blood.

**[06:36 - 06:38]** That is what the law demands.

**[06:38 - 06:46]** Now, it can be the blood of the guilty person or it can be the blood of an accepted substitute.

**[06:46 - 06:52]** But death is the trust penalty, it's what justice demands.

**[06:52 - 06:58]** When we who are human beings rebel against a holy, just and good God, justice according

**[06:58 - 07:01]** to the law requires death.

**[07:01 - 07:09]** And the law doesn't bend, the law does not bend for anybody.

**[07:09 - 07:17]** So respectfully, I'm saying this, so it didn't even bend for God.

**[07:17 - 07:20]** I'm saying this respectfully, I want you to understand God is the one who established

**[07:20 - 07:24]** the law also, but I want you to understand that even the one who established the law who

**[07:24 - 07:28]** is really greater than the law, himself submitted to the law.

**[07:28 - 07:37]** The law didn't say since your God and you love them and you want to forgive them, let's

**[07:37 - 07:40]** just forgive them.

**[07:40 - 07:41]** It didn't bend for God.

**[07:41 - 07:46]** God didn't want it to bend for him because the law is just the law, his holy, God is holy.

**[07:46 - 07:52]** So God himself submitted to the law, you hear me?

**[07:52 - 07:59]** That's why God had to send the sun, that's why Jesus had to become men, so that he can die

**[07:59 - 08:01]** in order to fulfill the law.

**[08:01 - 08:13]** The good news is he has died and he has fulfilled the law and therefore the law itself now

**[08:13 - 08:19]** accepts the fact that he has fulfilled it and therefore releases all of us.

**[08:19 - 08:29]** Say hallelujah, so this verdict of not guilty, which is being declared right just before

**[08:29 - 08:39]** God, being justified before God, is a verdict that has been issued by the law itself because

**[08:39 - 08:42]** it is satisfied.

**[08:42 - 08:52]** Hallelujah, Nibbasa, if you are in Christ, you are legally released from your guilt,

**[08:52 - 09:03]** from the wrath of God, from divine punishment because of sin, you are legally released

**[09:03 - 09:04]** from the law.

**[09:04 - 09:10]** Therefore, you have no further obligations to the law.

**[09:10 - 09:15]** Scripture says you have died to the law.

**[09:15 - 09:19]** Why do you have no further obligations to the law because all the obligations you had

**[09:19 - 09:24]** to the law have been fulfilled by Jesus on your behalf?

**[09:24 - 09:28]** Again, nothing is simple being overlooked.

**[09:28 - 09:29]** Everything is being done by Jesus.

**[09:29 - 09:34]** That's why you should celebrate Jesus and that's why Jesus could say, I'm the way.

**[09:34 - 09:35]** I'm the truth.

**[09:35 - 09:41]** Nobody can come to the Father and say, nobody, nobody, that's why every other religion

**[09:41 - 09:50]** leads nowhere because Muhammad could not die.

**[09:50 - 09:59]** For your sins, he had his own, Confucius couldn't do it.

**[09:59 - 10:04]** None of these quote-unquote people could do it because it did die for yours who were

**[10:04 - 10:06]** died for theirs.

**[10:06 - 10:15]** But Jesus could, come on, say Jesus could, say Jesus could, say Hallelujah, amen, why could

**[10:15 - 10:21]** Jesus die because he's the only one born of a virgin, came into the world with us sin and

**[10:21 - 10:29]** lived for 33 years a perfect light of faith and obedience satisfying the law in every way

**[10:29 - 10:32]** the law could find nothing to charge him with.

**[10:32 - 10:41]** And therefore the law could accept his death as a substitute for ours.

**[10:41 - 10:43]** Raise your hand.

**[10:43 - 10:48]** The whole world needs to hear about Jesus.

**[10:48 - 10:51]** More religions are not the same.

**[10:51 - 10:55]** It's not about loving everybody, it's not about being good.

**[10:55 - 10:59]** Your goodness before God is as filth or rags.

**[10:59 - 11:02]** That's what the Scripture says.

**[11:02 - 11:06]** Say, Hallelujah, amen.

**[11:06 - 11:15]** Now you keep in mind now that everything Jesus did while he was on earth was done to accomplish

**[11:15 - 11:21]** this goal of securing a verdict of not guilty for us.

**[11:21 - 11:24]** And here I mean, he wanted to make sure that this verdict would be everlasting.

**[11:24 - 11:33]** In other words, there's nothing that we could do that would reverse it.

**[11:33 - 11:37]** He didn't come to die so that we can reverse what he did.

**[11:37 - 11:41]** Then he should have said, he wasted his blood.

**[11:41 - 11:51]** If Jesus wasted his blood, if after going through all that he did, the verdict of not guilty

**[11:51 - 11:59]** can simply be reversed when you sin because I got news for you.

**[11:59 - 12:03]** You still sin.

**[12:03 - 12:10]** So if every job you sin, if the verdict depends upon you living perfectly, Jesus you died

**[12:10 - 12:14]** in vain.

**[12:14 - 12:16]** Here's a good news.

**[12:16 - 12:17]** You couldn't do it.

**[12:17 - 12:18]** I couldn't do it.

**[12:18 - 12:21]** We couldn't do it.

**[12:21 - 12:23]** Jesus could.

**[12:23 - 12:25]** And Jesus did for us.

**[12:25 - 12:28]** Say, Hallelujah.

**[12:28 - 12:34]** All the charges that were against us have been dropped.

**[12:34 - 12:40]** And they can never be brought back due to some future failure.

**[12:40 - 12:49]** This is why the Bible says that I sinned and iniquities I will remember who is God speaking

**[12:49 - 12:50]** to.

**[12:50 - 12:52]** He's speaking to all of those who believe in the sun.

**[12:52 - 12:57]** He's not speaking to those who are not in Christ, those who have not received them.

**[12:57 - 13:03]** They're sins and iniquities God remembers every day.

**[13:03 - 13:05]** And they are facing the wrath of God.

**[13:05 - 13:07]** The Bible says the wrath of God is upon them.

**[13:07 - 13:08]** But thank God.

**[13:08 - 13:10]** One day you hurt the gospel.

**[13:10 - 13:12]** That's why the whole world needs to hear the gospel.

**[13:12 - 13:15]** That's why your parents need to hear, your children need to hear it, your neighbors need

**[13:15 - 13:17]** to hear it, your coworkers need to hear it.

**[13:17 - 13:19]** The whole world needs to hear the gospel.

**[13:19 - 13:24]** Because one day you heard the good news that Jesus paid for the sins of the whole world.

**[13:24 - 13:30]** And if you will receive Jesus as your Savior and Lord, then the penalty of your sins are paid

**[13:30 - 13:34]** for by the blood of Jesus and you get released.

**[13:34 - 13:43]** Those who reject Christ will continue to abide under the wrath of God.

**[13:43 - 13:46]** That's why we got to win the Lord's Word.

**[13:46 - 13:52]** That's why we got to trust God and do all that we care with His power to get this gospel

**[13:52 - 13:59]** out here in the area that we're living in and across the ocean in those nations.

**[13:59 - 14:03]** Because unless they hear the gospel, they cannot believe it.

**[14:03 - 14:08]** And if they don't believe it, they cannot be saved.

**[14:08 - 14:09]** Okay.

**[14:09 - 14:21]** Say, say, say this justification, this declaration of righteousness is everlasting.

**[14:21 - 14:26]** It's important for you to understand that because the everlasting nature of this declaration

**[14:26 - 14:31]** is what makes the new covenant better than the old.

**[14:31 - 14:42]** The problem with the old was every year they had to keep offering sacrifices over and over

**[14:42 - 14:45]** and over and over.

**[14:45 - 14:49]** And Jesus says in John, in Hebrews chapter 10, he says, sacrifice an offering's God, you

**[14:49 - 14:51]** are not pleased with it.

**[14:51 - 14:53]** Why was God not pleased?

**[14:53 - 14:59]** Because all of those sacrifices did not achieve God's purpose.

**[14:59 - 15:02]** Men were still guilty, men were still condemned.

**[15:02 - 15:08]** The blood sacrifice is never set all the sin problem for God, nor for us.

**[15:08 - 15:10]** So God was not pleased with it again.

**[15:10 - 15:17]** If you go to a doctor and the doctor keep giving you some injection every time you go, he

**[15:17 - 15:22]** sticks you, every time he goes, he sticks you, but the problem is not getting better.

**[15:22 - 15:23]** The problem is there.

**[15:23 - 15:25]** Will you still want to be stuck?

**[15:25 - 15:26]** Come on.

**[15:27 - 15:30]** What are you giving me is insulting the problem?

**[15:30 - 15:31]** Give me something that works.

**[15:31 - 15:33]** And basically that was what was happening.

**[15:33 - 15:39]** The blood of goats and animal sacrifices didn't solve the sin problem.

**[15:39 - 15:40]** God was pleased with God.

**[15:40 - 15:41]** I need something better.

**[15:41 - 15:50]** Jesus said, let me go and let me offer, men, the sacrifice, the sacrifice, let me present

**[15:50 - 15:57]** the blood that asked the power once and for all to set all the sin problem.

**[15:57 - 16:03]** Get these people delivered from the judgment and condemnation they were under and you

**[16:03 - 16:10]** can then declare that verdict of not guilty and it will stay.

**[16:10 - 16:20]** So hear me, it is the everlasting nature of the work that Jesus did that makes the new

**[16:20 - 16:29]** covenant better than the old that makes the blood of Jesus a better sacrifice.

**[16:29 - 16:37]** It is this everlasting nature that makes the priesthood of Jesus greater than that of Aaron

**[16:37 - 16:43]** and makes it an everlasting priest to somebody say, hallelujah, here is how Hebrews 10, 14

**[16:43 - 16:54]** percent for by one offering, he has perfected for ever those who are being sanctified.

**[16:54 - 17:02]** So all of us who are being sent apart unto God sanctified, all of us who are being sent

**[17:02 - 17:08]** apart unto God throughout faith in Jesus Christ, Jesus is one offering has perfected

**[17:08 - 17:09]** you forever.

**[17:10 - 17:31]** Raise your hand and say thank you Jesus, I am justified declares legally rights by the law in the eyes of the law.

**[17:31 - 17:40]** Therefore, the law has released you legally from itself, that's why Paul says you're no longer under the law.

**[17:40 - 17:42]** Are you hearing me?

**[17:42 - 17:45]** All right well let me answer the second question.

**[17:45 - 17:49]** You're justified but the Bible says you're justified by faith.

**[17:49 - 17:52]** You're justified by faith.

**[17:52 - 17:54]** What does that mean?

**[17:54 - 18:02]** It means that what Jesus has accomplished by his death, this verdict of not guilty, this being right before God.

**[18:02 - 18:18]** What Jesus accomplished all that cross which has provided forgiveness of sins that is equal to, all the sins of every man who ever lived or will ever live.

**[18:18 - 18:24]** All of that the blood of Jesus is sufficient to secure forgiveness for.

**[18:24 - 18:27]** Okay, that is a fact.

**[18:27 - 18:31]** And a man who wants to be saved right now can be saved.

**[18:31 - 18:37]** The blood of Jesus, I don't know how many people are living, but their billions today, if they become trillions, it doesn't matter.

**[18:37 - 18:46]** The value of the blood of Jesus is enough to cover the sin of every man, every woman, every born girl.

**[18:46 - 18:59]** So the potential for every human being to be delivered from wrath and hell is unlimited because of our Christ did.

**[18:59 - 19:06]** Nevertheless, no one can be saved.

**[19:06 - 19:19]** That forgiveness cannot take effect until an individual personally receives Jesus Christ as savior and law.

**[19:19 - 19:23]** You hear me?

**[19:23 - 19:37]** There is no such thing as universal salvation and some teach that because Christ died and because His blood was shed for everybody and because the blood paid the price for all our sins.

**[19:37 - 19:41]** Therefore, everybody is saved and everybody is going to heaven.

**[19:41 - 19:43]** That's not true.

**[19:43 - 19:51]** Because the Bible says here, you justify, it becomes yours through faith.

**[19:51 - 20:00]** Faith is essential for the receiving of this justification as available to everybody.

**[20:00 - 20:17]** I bet here's what the Bible says. The Bible says, by one man, Adam, sin enter into the world, by one man, it all became sinners, by the disobedience of one man, all became sinners.

**[20:17 - 20:29]** But it didn't stop there. It says not likewise through the obedience of one man, Jesus Christ, many shall be made righteous.

**[20:29 - 20:53]** Not all. Because all of those who actually placed their faith in Jesus as savior and law will actually experience partake of and benefit from His atoning work on the cross.

**[20:53 - 21:06]** So my question is, have you actually received Jesus as your savior and as your law? I didn't say do you come to church? I didn't say do you believe in God? I didn't say do you believe you need to be good?

**[21:06 - 21:13]** I didn't say do you need to keep the commandments? None of those things will save you. All of them are fine. None of them will save you.

**[21:13 - 21:32]** Here's what will save you. You personally individually placing your faith in Jesus Christ and the blood that He shed on cavalry as being sufficient to secure the forgiveness of all your sins and to make you right before God.

**[21:32 - 21:50]** Do you believe that? If you believe it say amen. If you believe it say hallelujah, if you are trusting in Jesus as your savior and trusting in His work on the cross as the only basis for your salvation, raise your hand and say thank you Jesus.

**[21:50 - 22:14]** Now, if you are trusting in yourself or putting confidence in yourself or in your church or in your vegetable, in your religion and not in Christ and Christ alone, you have not yet received nor appropriated this salvation that Christ has purchased for you.

**[22:14 - 22:30]** Let nobody leave here today without personally individually knowing that you have received Jesus as your savior and you have received the salvation as a gift.

**[22:31 - 22:51]** I hear me. No one can earn it. The Bible says there's none righteous. No, not one. So none can receive it, but all can receive it by faith if they realize it's a gift.

**[22:51 - 23:09]** And what is this gift? It is the gift of God's own righteousness. That's what God has given you and me. His own righteousness, not yours, but his own. You stand right now as righteous as God himself.

**[23:09 - 23:29]** You stand right now as righteous as Jesus. Bishop has blasphemy. No, it's a gift. I didn't say you earned it. I didn't say you achieved it. I'm telling you you can't. I'm telling you your own works are filter racks. I'm saying you can never achieve it. No matter how good you are.

**[23:29 - 23:44]** But if you have humbled yourself and received Jesus as your savior, this is what God has given you. His own righteousness. In fact, the Bible says you have received the very righteousness of God. He's made you that.

**[23:46 - 24:05]** Say he has made me as a gift of grace, motivated by his love. He has made me through Jesus Christ, the righteousness of God. That should be your mindset. When you go to God, you ought to be saying the righteousness of God is here, Father.

**[24:05 - 24:17]** That's becoming righteous as conscious as acting on what Christ said. Come and say the righteousness of God is here this morning, Father. How are you?

**[24:17 - 24:31]** When you deal with the devil, say the righteousness of God, just spoke to you. You go to God to the righteousness of God. When you're facing challenges, you're no match for the righteousness of God. I'm not afraid of you.

**[24:31 - 24:45]** Amen? When I tell you there are witches in the village, don't go to the village because witches in the village say, I am the righteousness of God in Christ.

**[24:45 - 24:58]** And the powers of darkness have no power over me. Say hallelujah. They tell you that they have formed weapons against you. You say no.

**[24:58 - 25:15]** Who have formed against me can prosper. You don't have to go and go for the days and go and see the prophet and come to somebody's altar and ask the men of God to pray for you and lose your sleep.

**[25:15 - 25:29]** All about is because you don't know what God has given you freely by grace. You don't understand what it means to be declared not guilty.

**[25:29 - 25:42]** You don't know what it means to be the very righteousness of God in Christ. The Bible says, a factor of fervent prayer of the righteous man. You are that righteous man.

**[25:42 - 25:56]** In Christ, say in Christ, I am that righteous man who's praise and his prayers are powerful because the righteous cry, the Lord hears him.

**[25:56 - 26:15]** People all of this is the doing of Jesus Christ. I said all of this mind what a savior. That's why it should be Jesus in the morning, Jesus at noon day. Jesus all through the day.

**[26:15 - 26:32]** Amen because he is the answer. He is the solution. Are you hear me? He's the one that has changed your life. He has changed your past. He has changed your present. And he will definitely change your future. Say hallelujah.

**[26:32 - 26:50]** Everybody says thank God for Jesus. Amen. Amen. Now hear me. The only way to be justified is to receive Jesus Christ and the gift of righteousness.

**[26:50 - 27:09]** Are you hear me? And it's unmarried. It's unearned. And it's undeserved. Never try to earn righteousness. When you try to do that, you forbid it. The thing that would disqualify you for salvation is you trying to earn salvation.

**[27:09 - 27:31]** Are you hear me? Because the minute you decide you're going to try to merit an earning work for it, you have an SS denied the sufficient of the blood.

**[27:31 - 27:43]** So you got to receive the hall as a gift without working for it. Now it takes faith to do that. And that's why a lot of people don't ever receive it.

**[27:43 - 28:05]** Because it takes faith to believe in me, me, with all that I know about me, that by faith in Jesus Christ and His work alone has secured righteousness and salvation for me, the Jews struggle with that.

**[28:05 - 28:27]** Why? They were religious. And religious people believe in law. And so for the gospel, the Paul preach to be to declare that salvation is not based upon works for by grace that you say through faith.

**[28:27 - 28:35]** And that not of yourselves, it is a gift of God and not of works which we have nothing to do with keeping the law.

**[28:35 - 28:47]** Is this a gift? The Jewish people who are very religious, who believe so much in the commandments as the way of salvation, could not believe that.

**[28:47 - 29:00]** And that was why many of them rejected Paul and eventually killed him because they wanted to hear the law.

**[29:00 - 29:10]** Well, that hasn't changed. Religious people and many of them are in our churches. Some of them are here today.

**[29:10 - 29:23]** You know, your intention is good, but you're just wrong because you don't understand the gospel. Are you still here?

**[29:23 - 29:38]** The Jewish people could not. The Bible says, to the Jew Paul said this message of the grace of God, this message of salvation by grace alone, by faith alone in Christ alone, it was a stumbling block.

**[29:38 - 29:45]** Yes, that's it. When they got there, I said, no, that's too much. No, no, no, it can't be true.

**[29:45 - 29:55]** And this is happening in many Christian chronical churches. I said, many of you say that it's a stumbling block because they might know.

**[29:55 - 30:15]** It cannot be. How God will save you like that. That's the gospel. And it takes faith. And if you can believe it, the Greeks,

**[30:15 - 30:26]** who like wisdom said, that's foolishness. And so I don't know whether you agree today or Jew, but those of us who believe,

**[30:26 - 30:37]** oh, the possible answer, this gospel of Jesus Christ is what? The power of God that produces salvation.

**[30:37 - 31:03]** One more time. Say, thank God for his grace and for salvation through the blood of Jesus. I believe. Amen. Now, there's some, there's some who want to receive Him simply as Savior,

**[31:04 - 31:13]** because what they want is to be delivered from the penalty of sin. And there are some folks who preach grace. They call it free grace.

**[31:13 - 31:23]** They got all different kinds of grace, but there's the free grace theology that says, all you got to do is pray the sinner's prayer.

**[31:23 - 31:34]** All you got to do is simply exercise your faith once I exercise into your heart and how you live doesn't matter.

**[31:34 - 31:43]** As you can receive him as Savior, you don't have to receive him as Lord. It's in your interest to receive him as Lord.

**[31:43 - 31:53]** But you can be saved everlasting. So by simply believing in what he did on the cross.

**[31:53 - 32:15]** So you can receive the Savior because you want to be delivered from the penalty of sin which is hell. I don't believe that one bit because Jesus came to save us from sin, not to save us from hell.

**[32:15 - 32:30]** Thank God we get saved from hell, but hell is not the real evil, the real evil is sin. I hear me. It was sin that brought about the fall. It was sin that caused all the problems.

**[32:30 - 32:46]** It is sin that is a rebellion against God. The problem is sin. I hear me. And Jesus came to save from sin not just from the consequence of sin or the punishment of sin.

**[32:47 - 33:03]** He does that, but fundamentally he came to save us from what? Sin. And so believing on him and receiving him is receiving him as Savior and Lord.

**[33:03 - 33:11]** As Savior who will deliver you from the penalty of sin and as Lord who will deliver you from the power of sin.

**[33:12 - 33:31]** You see as Savior he delivers you from the wrath of God that is to come. As Lord he breaks the power of sin and he works in you and causes you both to will and do the things that please him.

**[33:32 - 33:42]** So you must trust sin to deliver you from the penalty of sin, but trust sin just as much to deliver you from the power of sin.

**[33:42 - 33:54]** Don't go about God. I know he would deliver me from the penalty of sin, but when it comes to the power of sin I have to do it myself. You follow me?

**[33:55 - 34:04]** He came to deliver you from the power of sin. And what he did on the cross, ladies and gentlemen, deliver you from the penalty and also from the power.

**[34:04 - 34:19]** That's what the Bible means when it says you were crucified with him. So on the cross, and I would have another sermon for this, on the cross Jesus dealt with the punishment of sin, but he also dealt with a sinner.

**[34:20 - 34:43]** It's like you want to stop people from smoking. And so you go and you pass a law of no smoking, and you collect all the cigarettes, but you need the cigarette factory.

**[34:44 - 35:08]** Do you think you were able to achieve a situation where there's no smoking? No, no. In fact, you don't have to worry about the cigarettes dealing with the factory. And if there are no cigarettes, whether they like it or not, there will be no smoking.

**[35:08 - 35:24]** God is not a fool. The plan, the plan of salvation was never just to take away sins of the penalty. God was going after sin itself. And that is why on the cross, God didn't want to deal with your sins. He dealt with a sinner.

**[35:25 - 35:47]** And so when we get to Romans 6, 1, 4, I would say, don't you know you are dead to sin? That sinner is dead. You have a new nature. Hallelujah. And so the trust for me, sir, will take place in you as you trust him as savior and Lord.

**[35:47 - 36:16]** Are you hear me? Learn to say, Jesus, you are my savior. Who has the liberty from the penalty of sin? Because you shared your blood. There's no health for me because you shared your blood. There's no wrath of God waiting me. Hallelujah. Thank you for your grace. And I love you. Amen. But Jesus, thank you. That you didn't want to deal with my, with my, with my sins, you dealt with me, the sinner. On the cross, you put that old man to death. You made me a new creature. And thank you, Jesus. You are working.

**[36:16 - 36:42]** Jesus, you are working in me right now every day. You're changing me. You're transforming me. Jesus, I trust you. I'm struggling here, but I trust you for the deliverance. I start, I'm struggling here, but I'm trusting you for the victory because you are my Lord. Sin will not have the meaning over me because you are my Lord. Sin cannot rule over me because you have already overcome sin for me. You follow me. I trust you.

**[36:42 - 36:57]** So you place your faith in the Savior to knowing he has delivered you from the penalty of sin. You place your faith to the Lord knowing that he has broken the power of sin and is exercising dominion over sin in you.

**[36:57 - 37:21]** But I think you got to believe because these things become experiential as you believe it. Is this gospel good or not? How long have you been preaching? I got 13 whole moments, 13 more minutes, great.

**[37:21 - 37:42]** Alright, so now that's that I've gone over being justified and being justified by faith, right? Now, here are the three treasures that are the result of being justified by faith. He says, being justified by faith, we have what? Peace with God.

**[37:42 - 38:08]** We have what? What do you have right now with God? What do you have? What is the state of your relationship with God? Is it one of racked or one of peace? Really? You really believe that? Amen. Amen.

**[38:08 - 38:28]** So we have peace with God. And that means we are totally completely reconciled. God is completely reconciled to us. There's nothing in God's heart or in his mind that he's holding against you.

**[38:28 - 38:58]** I know some of you are waiting for answers to prayer and the devil is telling you that because of this, something you did years ago. I mean, I think Pastor Obi was in, it was in Virginia, at the church there, when a lady who had been with you for a long time and who had been a Christian for a long time, I was there that day and she was sharing how she had done something. I don't know what it was, but was something her past.

**[38:58 - 39:11]** Even though this lady had been in church for so long, this thing that she had done in her past, she was convinced was blocking her blessing that God was holding against her, et cetera. I said, someone here, that's how you feel.

**[39:11 - 39:23]** You still feel there's something you did in your past. God is still holding against you today. And for that reason, God will not bless you. God will not hear your prayer.

**[39:23 - 39:34]** But let me be the mouth of God for you today. As far as God is concerned, he has nothing against you.

**[39:40 - 40:03]** I have nothing against you. Right? Now, if Papa can do things I do, he will miss the kind of fellowship communion and whatever benefits I blessing I could be to him, he will miss it because he thinks I have something against him.

**[40:03 - 40:23]** This is what spiritual warfare is principle above. They devilized us and pushed us in bondage. The essence of know the truth. Jesus said when you know the truth, the truth will set you free. And here is the truth because of Jesus. And it's only because of Jesus.

**[40:23 - 40:34]** I want you to understand this. It has nothing to do with you. But because of Jesus's love and the work he did on the cross right now.

**[40:34 - 41:00]** As far as God is concerned, there is peace. That means the war has ended. God is not dropping bombs. There is no curse. That is upon you now because God has cursed you.

**[41:00 - 41:20]** Christ redeemed us from the curse. That means he bought our freedom from the curse. If Christ's blood purchased my liberty from the curse, why would I accept some theology? That says that I am curse.

**[41:20 - 41:30]** Oh God, Jesus living in me. I live in Jesus. Blood of Jesus shared from me. And you tell me I'm curse. If what Christ did on the cross, did not break the curse.

**[41:30 - 41:44]** 40 days of prayer fasting will not break it. Amen. Giving one million dollars in the offering will not break it.

**[41:45 - 41:53]** You're going to have better reasons for praying and better reasons for giving than believing the lie of the devil.

**[41:53 - 42:12]** Say Christ has set me free. And now I have peace with God. So let me break it down. It means the end of hostilities, the nullification of all judgment,

**[42:12 - 42:26]** the cancellation of all debts, the removal of all legal and relational barriers. None. God no longer sees or treats you as an enemy.

**[42:26 - 42:42]** Things that once had the power to separate you from God no longer can separate you from God for the man who is in Christ. Hallelujah. Amen.

**[42:42 - 43:00]** But it doesn't want to mean those negative things are gone. It means there is the presence of good will. Peace with God means that he has granted you the status of sons, not mere servants or sinners.

**[43:00 - 43:11]** It means he is actively and he is forcefully for you. Not possibly. He is actively and forcefully.

**[43:11 - 43:31]** No, you didn't say I said say forcefully. Say forcefully for you. He's not just sitting and waiting and for things to happen. He's actively forcefully making things work for you.

**[43:31 - 43:45]** Actively forcefully resisting your enemies. Actively forcefully making everything work together. Hallelujah.

**[43:45 - 43:59]** Means that he's that constant friend that is sticking closer to you than a brother. It means he will never leave you on your own.

**[43:59 - 44:08]** It means he was with all no good thing from you. It means he loves you just as much as he loves Jesus.

**[44:08 - 44:24]** It means he will hear your prayer just like he hears Jesus is prayer.

**[44:24 - 44:41]** This is so yeah. Why? Because he loves you. Don't let the devil steal. Don't let the devil steal that reality from you.

**[44:41 - 44:52]** In this world we will have tribulation. Hear me. God has made peace with you. The devil has not.

**[44:52 - 45:12]** So you need to know when trouble comes. Where is coming from? I hear me. So Jesus says look don't worry. He says in this world you will have tribulation for a bit of good share.

**[45:13 - 45:26]** I have overcome the word meaning. I'm for you. Between God and you there's peace no war. You and the devil. You and this world are still at war.

**[45:26 - 45:40]** But he has a good thing because you have peace with God. You now have access which is the next treasure. So this grace in which you stand.

**[45:40 - 45:59]** I hear me. And this grace in which you stand gives you the power to rule and reign in life. So even though you will and you must and you will continue to deal with tribulation and trials and suffering because there is an enemy and you are still living in a fallen world.

**[45:59 - 46:08]** So it's good to know that God is not the one fighting against me. It's good to know like the Apostle said if God be on my side who shall be against me.

**[46:08 - 46:20]** So the revelation of Hallelujah that I have peace with God and therefore I now stand in the grace of God having access to the grace of God.

**[46:20 - 46:29]** Empowers me in the time of tribulation to go through the tribulation face the enemy not be overcome by him.

**[46:29 - 47:01]** So I'm standing in the grace of God. So I have peace with God. I'm justified and as a result I am standing living, walking, abiding in the unmerited and undeserved favor of God.

**[47:01 - 47:25]** I go to sleep enjoying unmerited favor. I wake up to unmerited favor. I go to work in unmerited favor. Everywhere I am I live in, I abiding, I swim in, I know nothing but unmerited and undeserved favor in Christ Jesus.

**[47:25 - 47:46]** I didn't get to ex-found on the second treasure fully grace and I didn't touch the third treasure hope.

**[47:46 - 47:53]** We're going to do that in subsequent messages but for now I just want you to know this.

**[47:53 - 48:07]** You have peace with God because you're justified. You have peace with God. You stand in the grace of God and you have hope.

**[48:07 - 48:20]** That peace is important. I don't know if they have done a scientific study to prove my point but whether they did or not I'm right.

**[48:20 - 48:34]** Amen. The truth is I believe in all my heart that the number one reason why people have to receive a goal looking for therapy is because of loss of hope.

**[48:34 - 48:47]** That hope is at the root. It's not all the great majority of the problems. We have sadness, depression, discouragement, loss of motivation, giving up.

**[48:47 - 48:56]** Amen. If you trace it, most of those emotions are psychological states that sometimes they become physical.

**[48:56 - 49:13]** The root is at some point somebody lost hope. So when Baba says three things faith, hope and love, faith is important, love is important but guys hope is extremely important.

**[49:13 - 49:24]** And I found that there are many Christians who ought to be enjoying the hope that is the results of being justified by faith having peace with God.

**[49:24 - 49:41]** Being able access to the grace of God, they should be always hopeful. Many lose their hope and then experience their effects of hopelessness.

**[49:41 - 49:55]** That doesn't need to happen if we are rooted and grounded in the hope that Paul speaks of here. Hope is important and there are many different things we hope for and it's good to have hope.

**[49:55 - 50:05]** Hope that you one day you get married. There's a person that is best for you. Hope that you one day you own your business. Hope is important because when you don't have hope there's no motivation, right?

**[50:05 - 50:11]** But none of those earthly hopes should be the anchor for your soul.

**[50:11 - 50:24]** Because here's the fact Paul says hope doesn't disappoint. He was talking about the hope that comes from God. They are upon the work of Jesus Christ.

**[50:24 - 50:35]** That hope we should talk about is what you anchor your soul because that one would not disappoint. The reality is all the other hopes can and sometimes do disappoint.

**[50:35 - 50:47]** And if you anchor your soul to them, you set yourself up for discouragement, despair, loss of motivation, backsliding, all of those things in Jesus' name.

**[50:47 - 51:12]** Say, Father, thank you today that because of Jesus I am justified declared righteous in your sight that I have peace ever lasting peace that can never be taken away from me in Christ Jesus.

**[51:12 - 51:29]** Hallelujah. I thank you Lord that I stand, I live, I walk, I abide in this realm of unmerited grace and favor in the mighty name of Jesus.

**[51:29 - 51:43]** And last, Father, I thank you for the hope that is the anchor of my soul that is rooted in this peace I have with you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

**[51:43 - 52:07]** So in subsequent messages, we will explore more that subject of hope. Hallelujah. In Jesus' name, yeah, send up and give God some praise.

**[52:07 - 52:40]** Hallelujah. Jesus Christ is Savior and Lord. Amen. Keep reminding yourself every day that God treats you as though you have never once broken any commandment in Christ because Jesus broke no commandment for you.

**[52:40 - 52:51]** And then remember that he treats you as though you have always obeyed him perfectly. Why? Because Jesus obeyed him perfectly for you.

**[52:51 - 53:15]** One more time, Jesus, I love you. Amen. God bless you now. If you're here today and you have not truly received Jesus as your Savior, you haven't.

**[53:15 - 53:25]** Really got to that point in your life where you realize your sinner, you couldn't save yourself, you realize you're bound by sin, you couldn't deliver yourself.

**[53:25 - 53:38]** And you needed a Savior, you needed help, you turned to the only one who could help you pardon your sins as your Savior and break the power of sin over your life as the Lord.

**[53:38 - 54:01]** If you have never done that, please do it today. Amen. If you are one of those who have received Christ, but you have not embraced for it what you have, you have continued to think wrong thoughts based upon false doctrine of emotions.

**[54:01 - 54:17]** Take the time to listen to these messages enough to change and transform your thinking so you can walk in the experience that God has made possible even in this world where there is tribulation.

**[54:17 - 54:28]** Do you hear me, church? I'm going to ask you to be seated and ask the elders, the pastors to come. We're going to give some time for prayer.

**[54:28 - 54:38]** We're going to take just a few minutes. So if you need prayer, we want you to come quickly. Hallelujah. If you need, if you want to receive Jesus, you can come at this point.

**[54:38 - 54:48]** If you say, listen, I really have backslid and I want to just get reconnected to the things of God so I can start growing again. Come.

**[54:48 - 54:56]** If you have a physical spiritual need, a family need, come. We're going to take a few minutes to pray for you. We have some words of knowledge.

**[54:56 - 55:04]** Do you have anything concerning healing? Nothing. Okay.

**[55:04 - 55:24]** Okay. How are you doing, Prescott? I have a word of knowledge concerning pain from your neck all the way down on your shoulder and then also pain on this side. If that's you, God wants to heal you. If you can stand, God wants to bless.

**[55:24 - 55:38]** So what you can do is just come to pass the OBE. If that's you, he will pray for you. Quickly, quickly. Come. Go ahead. You go ahead and say it quickly.

**[55:38 - 55:44]** The rest of you, you can start coming. You can start coming for prayer. You can start coming for prayer.

**[55:44 - 55:54]** I had a couple of words of knowledge. Somebody with a sharp pen in your left knee, receive your healing if that is you. I mean, come for prayer.

**[55:54 - 56:15]** Somebody with a pen on your left eye, there's pressure on that eye. Also, there's healing available here for you. And if you have been on your Thai, you don't receive your healing, there's also somebody with an issue, something with your truth.

**[56:15 - 56:36]** If it's like you even lost your voice because of the pain, pain on your throat, the Lord is healing you tonight and restoring your voice, pain on your shoulder. And the pain on your shoulder goes to your back and it's on the right side of your back.

**[56:36 - 56:39]** So if that's you, come for prayer.

**[56:39 - 56:49]** So if you are experiencing any of those things, come and receive prayer but don't limit that, if you need prayer for any area right now, come and let the pastors elders pray for you.

**[56:49 - 57:08]** There's also another one, be sure. Healing for chest tightness and chest pain, wrist, pain, anxiety, depression, fear.

**[57:08 - 57:16]** If you need of those things, come and thank Jesus. As we're praying when I ask the prayer, they pray seem to just softly lead us in.

## Sermon Summary

Bishop Darlingston Johnson delivers a powerful New Year's Eve message declaring 2026 as the "Year of Unfailing Love" for Harvest Intercontinental Church. Speaking from Jeremiah 31:3 - "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness I have drawn you" - the Bishop unpacks what it truly means when we say "God loves you."

### The Nature of God's Unfailing Love

**1. Everlasting Love (No Beginning, No End)**
- God's love has no starting point and no expiration date
- It existed before you were born, before the foundation of the world
- God's love never takes a vacation - not even when we are rebellious
- His love is not based on our performance; it doesn't fluctuate like a roller coaster
- Nothing we do can diminish His love, and nothing we do can increase it - it is already perfect

**2. Loving Kindness - A Love That Acts**
- The Hebrew word for "loving kindness" speaks of covenant love
- This love is not passive sentiment or mere good feelings
- It is a love that ACTS - it draws, gives, provides, protects, and intervenes
- When God says "I love you," He means "I am going to take action on your behalf"
- God's love compels Him to help - He cannot stand by passively

### Key Revelation: "God Cannot Not Help You"

Bishop Johnson shares a powerful insight: Because God IS love (1 John 4:8), and love by its very nature acts on behalf of the one loved, God literally cannot withhold help from His children. As the Bishop boldly declared to God: "You cannot not help me. Your love is too strong. You are a prisoner of Your own love."

This is not irreverent - it is truth. God cannot cease to be God, therefore He cannot cease to be love, therefore He cannot cease to act on our behalf.

### The Prodigal Son Illustration

The father in Luke 15 demonstrates God's unfailing love:
- He never stopped loving despite the son's rebellion
- He didn't wait for the son to prove himself
- He ran to embrace his dirty, smelling son
- His love was not based on the son's behavior but on his own nature as a father

### Romans 8: Nothing Can Separate Us

The sermon climaxes with Romans 8:31-39, revealing:
- If God is for us (loves us), who can be against us and WIN?
- The cross PROVES God's love - look at the nails, the crown, the blood
- The resurrection DEMONSTRATES the power of love - even death couldn't stop it
- Nothing in all creation can separate us from God's love

### What God's Love Has Already Accomplished

According to Romans 8:29-30, God's love has already:
- **Called** you - this cannot be undone
- **Justified** you - your righteousness is secure
- **Glorified** you - your destiny is sealed

Because love has already conquered, we are MORE THAN CONQUERORS. We don't fight FOR victory; we stand IN the victory already won.

### Personal Testimony

Bishop Johnson shared how when the ministry needed $10,000 for the university gap, the Holy Spirit reminded him: "Who told you that God needs you to support Him? You need Him to support you." After he stopped worrying and started thanking God, a young church member unexpectedly gave him an envelope containing $20,000 - provision for two months.

### Call to Action for 2026

1. **Settle the issue** - God loves you with an everlasting love, regardless
2. **Don't ask if God loves you** - the cross answered that question
3. **Trust His love** - it is the foundation for facing every test and trial
4. **Receive His love** - then reflect it to others
5. **Declare your position** - "I am more than a conqueror through Him who loved me"

## Prayer Points

### 1. Revelation of God's Unfailing Love
> *"I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness I have drawn you."* (Jeremiah 31:3 NKJV)

Father, in this Year of Unfailing Love, I pray for a deep revelation of Your everlasting love. Help me settle once and for all that You love me - not based on my performance, but because of who You are. Remove every lie of the enemy that suggests Your love takes vacations or has limits. Let me know and believe the love You have for me (1 John 4:16).

### 2. Freedom from Fear Through Love
> *"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear."* (1 John 4:18 NKJV)

Lord, as I enter 2026, I declare that Your unfailing love casts out every fear. I will not be afraid of tests, trials, or the enemy because Your love is the most powerful force in the universe. Death itself could not separate me from Your love. I face this year grounded in the truth that You love me with an everlasting love.

### 3. Experiencing God's Active Love
> *"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."* (1 John 4:7-8 NKJV)

Father, thank You that Your love is not passive but active. You don't just feel good about me - You act on my behalf. You provide, protect, intervene, and help. I trust that You cannot NOT help me because You cannot cease to be love. In every challenge I face, I expect Your loving kindness to move on my behalf.

### 4. Standing as More Than a Conqueror
> *"Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."* (Romans 8:37 NKJV)

Lord Jesus, I declare that because of Your love, I am MORE than a conqueror. The battle has already been fought and won. I will not fight FOR victory but stand IN the victory Your love has already accomplished. Every devil, demon, principality, and trial that shows up in 2026 - Your love has already conquered. I walk in that victory!

### 5. Confidence in What Love Has Accomplished
> *"For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."* (Romans 8:38-39 NKJV)

Father, I am fully persuaded that nothing can undo what Your love has already done. You have called me - it cannot be undone. You have justified me - it cannot be reversed. You have glorified me - no power can change my status. I stand in the position Your love has placed me, and from this place I will live, pray, and enforce the enemy's defeat in Jesus' name!

### 6. Reflecting God's Love to Others
> *"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."* (John 13:34-35 NKJV)

Holy Spirit, help me to not only receive God's unfailing love but to reflect it. Let love be the defining culture of my life - in my home, my ministry, my service, and my community. May I not merely speak about love but live it out in action and truth, so that the world may know I am His disciple. Let Your love flow through me to others in 2026.

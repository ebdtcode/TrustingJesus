another with humility, with patience, and grace. And as a church family, indeed, the entire Him, you church family, we will make love our defining culture. Love in our homes, love in our ministries, love in our service, and love in our community. We will not merely speak about love, but we will live it out in action and in truth so that the world, this world may know that we are His disciples. In 2026, we will walk in on failing love, we will receive it from the Father, we will reflect it through the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will release it to the world by the power of the Holy Spirit. Welcome to your year of unfailing love. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Paola. Amen. Thank you, Father, for our year of unfailing love in Jesus' name. Amen. With that having been read, I want to speak to us tonight on the subject of unfailing love. Help us understand what it means for us when we say, God loves you. What does that really? And to do so, I want you to please turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 31. And we're going to read from verse 3, Jeremiah 31, verse 3. Yes, the Lord was speaking, and he was speaking to Israel. I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness, I have drawn you. Please repeat after me, say, yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness, I have drawn you. That is God speaking to Israel. And the setting, of course, is a time when Israel unfortunately is in rebellion as they to often were. And Jeremiah, the Weeping Prophet speaks to them, and he's speaking to a nation that because of their rebellion now is experiencing a lot of bad consequences. The walls of Jerusalem are broken, the gates are broken, the temple is in ruins, the people themselves are displaced. You're not at their homes, they're displaced in the nations. And now the living with pain and disappointment and failure and experiencing a measure of God's discipline. So when the Lord says these words to them, I have loved you with an everlasting love. It is to a disobedient and a rebellious people who are actually reaping the results of their disobedience that he speaks. And amazingly, he speaks to them in that condition. And there's not a word of rejection. There's not a word I told you so. Instead, he reaches into their situation. And while speaking to people who have rebuilt against them and who have committed idolatry, et cetera, he speaks to them. And the thing he says to them is, I have loved you. I have loved you. I have loved you with an everlasting love. That is, I have always loved you. Always. I have never once stopped loving you. In spite of all you did to me, in spite of your rebellion, in spite of your idolatry, I have never once stopped loving. Church, let's hear God speaking to us in the same manner tonight. And let's hear God speaking to us throughout 2026. Let's hear God saying to us, I have loved you with an everlasting love. And I will love you in 2026 with an everlasting love. You have not always behaved and you have not always done what you ought to have done. And sometimes you were just completely rebellious and disrespectful. But not once did I stop loving you because of that. I have loved you with an everlasting love. Raise your hand. I said, God, thank you for loving me with an everlasting love. So before God talks to them about obedience and restoration, he settles one issue. And this is the issue I have loved you. In this year of unfilling love, let's settle that issue. Once and for all, let's settle it. And every day in 2026, as we begin each day and as we go through each day, as we face the challenges that 2026 will bring, the test and trials that come with living on this light, on this earth. We're going to have to get to heaven to get rid of all of that. But hear me. We can go into 2026 with our being afraid. If we can truly grasp this revelation and settle the issue that God has loved us and that love is regardless. Can we agree church? Can you agree that God has loved you? And he has done so regardless. Man, if it wasn't regardless, we wouldn't be here tonight. I know you didn't hear me. If it wasn't regardless, none of us would be going into 2026. That's just a fact. And if we can settle it in our mind, that is so. We have the foundation upon which we can build our lives, upon which we can move forward in 2026, the foundation upon which we can resist the devil. In the midst of every test and trial, you and I need to be grounded on this truth. God loves me. This love, as we will see, is everlasting. And it is this love that would cure us in the 2026. An unfailing love that would punish our fears and make us more than conquerors. So let's look more closer. What is the nature of this love? Well, we already used the word a few times, but let me just make some comments. The nature of God's unfailing love is that it is what? Ever lasting. Jeremiah thought it was three, six, it is ever lasting. And that means it has no beginning. It has no starting point. You look back in the eternity as far back as you can go and keep going because eternity has no beginning. And one thing will be constant. That throughout eternity, both in your past and in eternity, future, one thing is going to be constant. There is no variation, no change in that is that God loves you and God loves us. It means that there is no time when the love of God takes time off. I know sometimes you think God's love has taken time off, but that's just your perception. That's the enemy suggesting a lie to you. But because the love of God is ever lasting, God never, his love never takes the vacation. I mean, he was talking to these people, these Israelites who were rebellious, who are adulterous. And you would think if there's any time that God's love would take a vacation or take some time off, it would be when they are misbehaving and rebellious and adulterous, God could say, this is a good time for me to step back and stop loving you. Stop caring for you. Stop being concerned for you. Stop helping you. Stop paying attention to you. I'm just going to take a vacation and wait until you're ready and then I will come back from my vacation and we can resume where I left off. But that's not the way it works. There's no starting points. There's no expiration date. There's no time off. There's no vacation. Say hallelujah. Raise your hand and say, God, your love never takes a vacation. God's love did not begin when you break the service prayer. I know sometimes we think that's when God started to love us, but we've got to say, no, no, God loved you before you got saved. If God didn't love you before you got saved, you never would have gotten saved. Do you know what he had to do? First of all, to make it possible for you to be saved through Jesus Christ. And then you know what he had to do in order to bring you to the place where you had enough sense to respond to the gospel, to believe the gospel and be saved. My goodness. Thank God. God's love for you did not begin when you prayed the service prayer. It started long before you were born because it existed all the way in what eternity passed. Before you failed. He loved you. Before your obedience, he loved you because you see his love is not based on your performance. His love is not a reaction to what you do because if it was that his love would be a roller coaster. Okay. She praised me just now. I love you. She just said something. She said she should not have said his love would be a roller coaster. But thank God. In 2026, our year I'm feeling love. One thing we're going to know and one thing we're going to be sure of is that the love of God is constant. There's nothing you will do and nothing I will do that would diminish God's love for you when I hold up. And there's nothing you need to do to increase his love for you because his love for you is already perfect. Complete. Thank God for human love. I love the fact that my wife loves me. Amen. And you know, I like it when people like me and love me and I'm sure it's the same for you. The human love is beautiful, but the problem with human love is that it does have a beginning and too often. I've seen two men of folks who came to the altar and said, did that the we part? Looked at each other, said publicly with a smile on their face and they were like because as long as you keep me happy. So too often human love has an end and we tend to confuse that with God's love. No, no, the Bible says this is love. Not that we love God, but that God loved us which means he says love was independent of our love. It wasn't quick pro. Hallelujah. God's love you before you took your first breath. God's love you God loved you before the foundation of the world. So God's love is everlasting. And that means it doesn't fail because you fail. It doesn't waver because you waver. A good picture of the love of God is seen in the story of the prodigal son, that father who in spite of all that the son did continue to love his son the same. And when the son decided to come back, the father didn't wait for him to get home and go through a period of long repentance and demonstrate that he was changed or different. The Bible tells us why the boy was yet a far away. That means that father every day was looking for his son to come back as that was his son. Son don't want he had no business don't misbehaving. Son needing some serious correction, but sometimes you know the correction comes in the circumstances. Nobody got to say nothing, he got to a place where he had to eat. He had to eat but from the from the pigs, you know food. I mean the circumstances themselves brought him to his senses. Father didn't have to say nothing. Amen. But you know you don't have to learn that way. You can learn from God's word. I mean there's just a lot of wisdom in the word of God because he loves you. He's put a lot of wisdom in his word. And you and I can just learn a lot about his wisdom from his word. How to live, how to treat one another, want to do what not to do. You don't have to go to the point where you about to eat from the pig's pile for you to come to your senses. Come to your senses tonight. Hey hear me? If you haven't come to your senses yet, come to your senses tonight. What's the system you come to to the realization that God loves you with an everlasting love and the best thing that can happen to you is to be loved by God. When the boy came to his senses he said, what am I doing here? Even the servants in my father's house have enough to eat and to spare. It will be better for me to be a servant in my father's house to be here acting up. And father didn't wait for the boy to come home. When he saw him afar off, he literally ran to him. The boy was dirty. He was smelling. He smelled like pigs. He looked probably like like pigs. It didn't matter to the father because the father's love was not based upon the son. The father loved him because he was a father. Are you hear me? And we need to understand that God's love for us comes from God's nature. God loves us because that's who God is. God is love. And so God's love is not a reaction to your behavior, my behavior. God's love comes from who God is. Say hallelujah. So God's love flows from His very nature. First John chapter 4 verse 8 says that God is love, our year. In 2026 in this year of unfeeling love, enter that year and go through that year. No matter what you face, no matter what test and they will come. Temptation will come. Tries will come. So we shouldn't even say what God loves us but. No, no. God loves us and. Are you hear me? Thank God he loves you because those trials are going to come whether he loves you or not. But because he loves you, you will be able to go and the Bible says that we'll get to that. In all of these things, it is his love that makes us more than conquerors. The love of God is for us and the love of God will empower us and grace us and supply everything we need to go into the trial and to come out of the trial. More than conquerors. The love of God will make us victorious in every test, in every trial because the love of God is unfeeling. I hear me. So don't say what God loves me but say they're trials and I hear me because it is the love of God that will make the difference. Am I communicating? Am I helping you? Yes, the second thing very quickly that I'm not able to see how much time I have so I don't know why I'm not seeing the time here. But the love of God according to the same Jeremiah, he says therefore with loving kindness I have what? Therefore with loving kindness I have. So God's love is described as loving kindness and loving kindness causes God to draw you. So that word loving kindness speaks of a covenant love that exists between us and God based upon the fact that God's love is everlasting. That word loving kindness describes a love that is not just a passive sentiment. It is not just a good feeling that God has about you. Oh, I love you. That means I feel I got some feelings. It's not just a mental acceptance of you. The word loving kindness speaks of a love that acts. It is a love that draws. It is a love that takes action. It is a love that gives. It's a love that provides. It's a love that protects. It is not passive. It is a love that acts on behalf of the one loved. And so when we speak of God's love being everlasting and we prepare to go into 2026, ground it in the revelation of that love. Let us understand that the love we're talking about is not just a good feeling. God is not just going to feel good about you. God is not just going to have some good mental thoughts. It means that God is going to take concrete action. God is going to take action. God is going to do what God needs to do in order to help you. God is not going to stand by and just let you have to suffer and go through stuff. He says, watching and say, hey, I love her. No. When God says I love you, God needs I am going to take action. I don't know what it matters to you, but I'm glad that when I go to 2026 and I face the test and I face the trials and I face the demons and I face the devil, I don't have to be afraid of them because I know that God loves me with an everlasting love. And this is a love that will compel God to take action. That God is not just going to sit down when I feel sorry for me. God is not going to simply be passive. No. God is going to act. God is going to move. God is going to hear praying. God is going to provide. God is going to intervene. God is going to step into the fire. Are you hear me with me and even though the fire is seven times harder than usual, his presence in me, his loving kindness is going to preserve me. And I will come out of the fire and the smoke will not be on on me because why? God did not just stand by and watch me. Yeah, I'm in the fire. Yeah, the fire is hot. But God is in it with me. And when God is in the fire, it makes all the difference. So don't go into 2026 saying that there will be no fire. You'll be disappointed. There will be fire. But go that knowing that God is going in it with you and God will not be passive. Amen? God's love for you will move God to act. For God's love is action. Remember the Bible says, if you see someone who's hungry or someone who is cold, he says, if you just say to them, be fed. But you don't do anything in order to feed them. Or you say to them on this cold night, be warm. But you do nothing to help provide them with clothing. The question is how then does the love of God dwell in you? In other words, that is not the love of God. God's love will never reduce, be reduced of mere words and sympathy. That is not the way God loves. God will never look at you and simply say, well, I hope you make it do your best. No, if God says to you, when you see someone who's hungry, do something if you can. If you see someone who's cold, do something if you can. That means that God will always act when he sees a need. He will always offer the help required. God will never, never say to someone he loves. Okay, hope you make it. I wish I were helping you. Because you will face challenges and you need to face challenges knowing that God is not just going to sit there and say, I love you. No, when God says, I love you, God means I am going to act. I'm going to help you. I'm going to work with you. I'm going to do something about this. Relay on me. Trust me. Work with me. I will help you. You will not go through this alone. I will not forsake you. I will not lead this to you, to you to handle by yourself. And somebody said, God and you are always a majority. Hallelujah. And that's why by the time we get to Romans 80 and that's what we're going to close when we get to Romans 8. By the time we get to Romans 8, the question is asked by the apostle Paul, what can separate us? I'm going to 2026 knowing nothing can separate me from the love of God. And that's huge. That's huge. Say hallelujah. So let me give you a testimony. Again, just to let you know, because I want you to understand when the Bible says his love and kindness have drawn you, it's saying that God is going to act. God is not simply going to be passive. This love is a love that moves on behalf of us. And I'm learning that the only thing that limits that love is our unbelief. The problem is not God's reluctance, because God is always posed a poised to help. That's his nature. In fact, let me say this way before I give you this illustrate. That's who God is. God is love. And love by definition acts, helps and gives. God is love. And the love of God is so strong. The love of God is so great for me. That God's love will not permit God. Not to help. God cannot look at me in my situation and not help. He said, why? Because God is love. And the nature of love is loving kindness. So God is love and love acts. I say this way. Sometimes I'm struggling because I don't want to sound irreverent. But I started to talk to God that way. I know my father understands. I need to hear myself say to him. He's okay. But I said to God, you cannot not help me. It's not possible. Your love for me is too strong. Your love for me is too great. You cannot not. You can't help yourself. God, you are a prisoner of your love. Again, I understand. It's not between me and God. And man, he doesn't take it as disrespect. But that's a fact. God cannot not help me. Now, I cannot receive the help. And that's the unbelief. And the unbelief is because we don't know the love of God as we should. But if we grow in the revelation of the love of God, and that's my prayer, that in 2026, we're going to grow in the revelation of his love. We would get to the place where we say, you know what? I'm not going to worry. I'm not going to be ashes. I'm not going to be afraid because of the situation because God cannot help himself. He got to help me because that's who he is. Say, God is love. And God cannot cease to be God. Therefore God cannot cease to be love. And love acts on behalf of the one who loves. So God cannot not help me because God has loved me with an everlasting love. Now, you can take that. I hope you can say it for yourself because that's why you need to get to. That's what all of us need to get to. Well, we can say God cannot not help me because God is love. And God did not cease to be God. Therefore God did not cease to be love. Oh my goodness. Let me ask you a question. Are your human being? Can you cease to be a human being? You cannot. Well, God is God. And God is love. God cannot cease to be God. But for him to be God, he has to be love. He cannot cease to be love. He cannot not help me because he loves me with an everlasting love. Amen. So I don't know about you, but in 2026, I plan to keep reminding God every problem, every challenge, every test. I was a God. I know you love and you love those everlasting love. So you got no way out of this one. Now, I'm not saying he wants to get out. You understand? But it's for my benefit. You got no way to get out of this. You just can't. And he just so he likes that because the father delights in blessing his children. Are you hear me? So once again, let me repeat you, when the Bible says God loves you with an everlasting love, that love is a love that acts. We're not talking about passion and passivity. We're not talking about feelings. We're talking about action. God for God to love the world. He gave action. So recently, I'm putting the practice what I'm preaching for myself. You know, we got to believe God and trust God for different things, the needs of the ministry. And one of the things we're doing has to do with the building of the university, cost money to do that. And you know, we're not at the place where we have enough students yet to be able to cover the cost. So there's a gap between tuition and the cost. And since I am quote unquote the visionary, they call me that. I guess, in principle, carry the responsibility to make sure that that gap is fulfilled. But I was getting to the place where I thought was my responsibility. I had to remind myself, no, no, no, no. He's the one who told me to do this. So this is his work. I hear me. And when I started to act as though I was responsible, the Holy Ghost spoke to me and said, who told you that God needs you to support him? Who told you that God is depending upon you to support him? You need him to support you. Look, Jesus took five loads and two fish. And that over five thousand men plus women and children somehow God was able to take care of that. So I was in the situation where we needed $10,000. And I was scratching my head. I got a little money in the bank. And I've used some before to help. And I was scratching my head. That's when he said, who told you you the one supposed to support me? So I said, you know what God, I'm not worrying about this at all. You cannot not help me. And you cannot not do this work. So I just stop worrying, start giving God thanks. And then you know what happened this past week? One of our young, young members who's left see those, she's somewhere else, came and found me and brought an envelope. And she said, I just wanted to come and say thank you. Thank you for all that this church has meant and this minister has meant and you have meant. And so she gave me this envelope. I was putting in my pocket. She said, no, open it. Now this was not anybody. My mind would have ever thought about in the situation. But I don't support God. God knows how to take care of his own business. I hear me and love me. He's going to act. And she she handed me the envelope and I opened it and $20,000. That's more than enough at least a couple of this month and next month. Hey man, so God has sent you at least two months and you know what? I give you that example because that's the kind of love that is going into. You're taking that kind of love into 2026. Hey man, you're going to see that kind of love working in your life when you rely on his love and you know his love and you trust his love and you know the power of his love. That's the kind of love that you will be experiencing in 2026. Say hallelujah. It's going to be concrete. It's going to be practical. It's going to be substantial. It's going to be evidential. It's going to solve problems. It will be the answer to need. It will be the answer to prayers. Are you listening to me? Say hallelujah. Amen. All of the requirements that we would know and believe the love that God has for us so we can rest in it. Some of you have heard of George Mueller and he had this orphanage and there's books of so many answers to pray how you they would need and I'm working in that. It's the same love. I can write my book and talk about how $20,000 showed up from nowhere. From my God already had it paid platform and I'm going to have many stories. I already got some but I'm declaring my stories will multiply. Acts were nationaled in 2026. Why? Because this love is everlasting and I'm going into 2026 with this love leading the way and I'm challenging you and I'm encouraging you that you were going to 2026 with this love on your mind with this love in your heart with this love in your mouth that you are going to 2026 and face every test every challenge on the foundation that God has loved me with an everlasting love and that love will never take efficacious and if God is loving me then God is acting on my behalf. So I will not be afraid I would trust, rely on, believe the love of God like first John tells us to do. Let me bring this quickly to a close. Turn to Romans chapter 8. Are you here? So here is my call to action for me and for you for all of us. Let's go into 2026. Convince persuaded absolutely persuaded that there's nothing that will separate us from the love of God. Let me tell you what that means. It means there's nothing that will stop God from loving you. Go into 2026. Convince. Nothing. Absolutely nothing will stop God from loving me and understand that love is not a feeling. Love is action on your behalf. Nothing will separate me. Say nothing will separate me from the love of God in 2026 and beyond. Say nothing will stop God from blessing me and loving me and meeting my needs and giving me strength and giving me victory in 2026. Absolutely nothing. Nothing will separate me. Nothing will stop me and listen to this. It means nothing can undo what his love has already done. The scriptures in Romans 8 says nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus concerning us. So what that means is all that God has already done because when my love is action it's not just thoughts. All that the love of God has already accomplished for us in Christ. There's nothing that can undo it and if you look at Romans 8 and you saw that verse 31, Paul begins to ask questions. He says what shall we say concerning all these things. If God before us, IE, if God loves you, that's what it means. If God that's what you mean, if God loves you, what shall, what's the question, what's the first question? What shall we say to these things? If God before us, if God loves us, who can be against us and win? He's not saying you have a lot of things against you. So don't be surprised with the stuff that will be against you, but your attitude should be, if God is for me or if God loves me because that's what it means for God to love your means is for you. Who can be, what can be against you and win? Why? Because anything that comes against you will have to deal with the love of God for you. If it has to overcome the love of God, it cannot win because it has to win against the love of God. But the love of God is the most powerful force in the universe. Why do I say that? Because Paul asks the question, why just separate us from the love of God and then he says, son, death, come on and the answer is no. So if death cannot undo what the love of God has done. Then the love of God is more powerful than death. Here is the proof that Jesus loves you the cross. You know what? You and I need to stop asking the question, does God love me? Does Jesus love me? Stop it. Stop asking the question whether he loves me as much as he loves so so. Stop it. Why should you stop it? Because God has answered that question convincingly. If you doubt that God loves you, look at the cross. Because God didn't just say it, he demonstrated. Amen. God commanded us love for us in the way we were yesterday. Christ died. So God didn't just say I love you. God demonstrated. He loves you. E-E-E, everlasting. But what he did on the cross. Look at the cross. Look at the nails. What do they say? I'm failing love everlasting love. Look at the crown of thorns. That's God's answer to the question. Whether he loves you. What does it say unfailing love? Look at the blood that Jesus shed. What does it say unfailing love? So the question whether he loves you or not has been answered. Don't raise that question again. And every time it comes to your mind, recognize it's the devil trying to limit you. Yeah, the devil is trying to limit you. The devil is trying to limit you. The devil is trying to limit you because he knows if you truly embrace the revelation of the love of God and you build your life on that love, nothing shall be impossible to you. I'm telling you something. God didn't just say I love you. He said it but beyond that he proved it on the cross by accepting his son who died on the cross for you. And so the question Paul asked to give us if he did not swear, did not withhold his son Jesus from you. What shall he with Jesus with hold from you? And what's the answer? Judge, I'm asking your question. If he did not swear Jesus, what will he withhold from you? Come on say nothing. Say nothing. How can God give Jesus his full of begotten son and then withhold from you the things you need? It is completely illogical. It's a crazy man who will give his son for someone and then refuse to give these lesser things that mean nothing to him. God doesn't need money. Why can't he give it to you? He doesn't need houses, he doesn't need labs, he doesn't need clothes, he doesn't need food. He will miss none of those things and one of the things that he valued and was a treasure that he loved was his only begotten son and that he was willing to give his son because of you and me, my goodness, what kind of love is that? What man of love is this? So don't ask that question, some questions, some questions, some wondering, it's such a going to 2026. Every day reminding yourself that when it comes to love, it is such a God loves me as much as he loves Jesus. And again, for my benefit, I could almost say he loved me more than he loved Jesus because he gave Jesus, for me, that God, God can do both of those things, but it's one of my benefit. If I give something for something else, it means what I am getting for what I'm giving is more valuable to me. How then can you doubt God's love for you? How can you question the value of your life? How can you question what you mean to God when God was willing to give Jesus in exchange for you? Here, take Jesus, let me have you. And then you have the decency to do with all yourself. Come on, God did that for you. And instead of opening your arms and say, let me hug you. Let me embrace you. I love you. Here I am, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. After giving his son for you, someone got to stand here and try to convince you still. Are you listening? So the cross, where am I? Where am I with the time, guys? The cross proves his love and the resurrection demonstrates that the love has the power, the love of God is strong enough to meet every need you have because there's no power strong enough to withstand the love. How do I know that death could not keep love in the ground? The love of God overcame the power of death, resurrected in order to give you life. If the death, if death, could not keep him, keep his love from resurrecting so that you can have life, then both said, I am convinced. I am full of persuaded that there is nothing in heaven or in earth, not angels, not principalities, not life, not death, not things above, not things beneath. I am convinced, Paul, absolutely nothing created can separate me from what the love of God has accomplished for me and what the love of God will do for me. There is no other force, there is no spiritual force, there's nothing in all of creation that is strong enough to overpower the love of God that is at work for me and in me and that will be working for you in 2026. Said absolutely nothing. That's going to 2026 as more than a conqueror's. That's why Paul said, Romans, I am convinced in all of these things we are what more than conqueror's through him who loved us. It is the love of God for you and it says revelation of God's love, that is invincible. That causes Paul to say, based on the knowledge of that love, we are more than conqueror's because when you are more than conqueror's it means that battle has already been fought, the victory is already won, the thing has already been accomplished and in this case we know all of that was accomplished by the love of God, reflected and manifested in Christ Jesus. Now you are more than conqueror because love has already conquered. I am declaring over you every test, every devil, every demon, every principality that shows up in 2026, you need to look at and say the love of God has already conquered you and my attitude towards you is simpler this I am more than a conqueror. I'm not going to waste any time on you because the love of God already overcame you. I'm going to walk in the victory which the love of God has already obtained. Are you listening to me? Hear me! There is nothing in heaven, no principles, no demons, nothing created, that would be able to undo what the love of God in Christ has already accomplished. What has this love accomplished? Paul says in Romans 8 a little bit earlier, just before Romans 831, Paul says, whomever he for new, he predestined to be conformed to the image of Jesus, and whomever he predestined he called, and whomever he called he justified, and whomever he justified, he glorified. So the love of God in Christ has already called you, justified you, glorified you, and that Paul said, what should we say to these things? In other words, if the love of God has already accomplished these things to you, there's nothing that can undo it. Nothing that will undo your glorification, it's done. The love of God has accomplished if nothing can undo it. Nothing can undo your justification, your righteousness and God's sight. Are you hear me? And there's nothing in heaven or earth that will undo it, because the love of God has accomplished it. Nothing will undo the call. Are you hear me? I don't care what the enemy has done or planned, those things are done, and there's no power that can undo that for you or me. So I'm going into 2006 more than a conqueror, because I know I've been called by the love of God. I've been justified by the love of God. I've been glorified by the love of God, and there's nothing in heaven or earth that can change my position or change my status. That is where I am. That is where I stand. It is from that place that I will live. It is from that place that I will pray, and it is from that place that I will enforce the devil's defeat. I will not fight for victory because the love of God already secured the victory. I will stand in the victory, which the love of God has accomplished, and I will say to every devil, I will say to every demon, I will say to every person, I will say to every devil, I will say to every trouble, I will say to every sound. In Christ, more than a conqueror. Stand to your feet. Come on. Raise your hand. Many of you here are already the children of God. My prayer for you is that you will embrace this revelation concerning the unfilling love of God, and through our 226, 2026, you will grow increasingly in that revelation. And as you do so, this is what Paul said, you will be filled with the fullness of God. Are you hear me? Now, when you receive that love, you are then to reflect that love. How can you receive this kind of love and not reflect it? So let that love that you have received from him, flow in you, and then flow through you back to those that you know, and those that you are at fellowship with their interaction with their living with here at this church in your home, wherever you are, believe the love that God has for you, and then allow that same love to flow under your hearts, out of your mouth, out of your life to others so that through you others can come to know this same love that has changed you in Jesus name. Brothers, let us love one another for love is of God, and he that love it, know it, God, for God is love. Come and say that, for God is love. So may God's love flow in you and flow through me in 2026, but there are some here who have been deceived by the enemy. And for that reason, you have not yet received Jesus Christ, and the love of God that is in Christ has not yet touched you and transformed you because for one reason or the other, you have come to believe that you are not worthy, that you must earn it, that you must be able to produce righteousness, and all of those things have kept you from receiving the love of God, and allow the love of God to transform you from the inside out. Listen to me, I'm about to give an alter call. This alter call is for the man, the woman who's here, and who says, the shepherd, I need to respond to this message. I need to receive Jesus Christ, in whom the love of God abides. I need to receive this love from God, which comes through Christ. I need to receive Jesus tonight as my Savior and as my Lord. I need to start to grow from that to know this love that passeth understanding, but I must start tonight when receiving this love. You see, God gave Jesus because He loved you, but that's what He had to do, what He cannot do for you is to receive Jesus for you. That you have to do. This alter is that for perfect people tonight. That's done. This alter is for humble people, humble people, not perfect people, humble people who say, I need Jesus. I haven't received Christ as my say. I know about it, but I have not received it. I haven't repented of sins and received things as my love and Savior. So I really don't know much about this love you're talking about. I want to receive the Savior tonight. This alter is not for perfect people. This alter is not for people who are promising they will be perfect after they come. This you're not going to be Christ as the one who changes you. This alter tonight is for the humble man, the humble woman who will come and say, Jesus, I cannot save myself. Jesus, I'm a sinner. Jesus, I need the salvation that only you can give. Jesus, I need that love that I heard about tonight. That is the person for whom this alter is designed. And if you will come tonight in response to this invitation, I promise you, I promise you because of the love of God and because of what Christ has already done, all of your sins will be forgiven. Every single one, that's what love does. And you will stand before God tonight for the first time ever in your life, holy. And blameless in his sight. Is that something you need who will pray for you? And tonight, your sins are going to be removed. Tonight for the first time, you're going to receive the life of God inside of you. And tonight for the first time, you will be righteous and holy in God's sight. It's what the humble man is. Is there a humble person here? Is there a humble woman here? As the praise team leads us, I want you who want to pray. Now, you may say, Bishop, I receive Christ, but I'm excellent. But tonight, during the worship or during the word, my heart was moved. I need to re-dedicate my rights to Jesus. You can come to Him in Jesus name. Or you may say, Bishop, I need to be a part of this church. I believe that in this church, I will grow and I want to be a member, I want you to come to. So come. If you're humbly enough to admit your need, come. If you're humbly enough to say, I'm excellent, I need to be restored. Come. If you're humbly enough to say, I need a church like this to help me grow. Come. I'm going to ask some of the pastors to come very quickly. Let's say and then you stop making a way to the front quickly, please. We need prayer for salvation, come quickly. We don't have a lot of time. If you need to re-dedicate your life, come quickly to express your desire to be a member of this church, come very quickly. The rest of you, be praying for them. Christ, you've got to humble yourself in God before I took a-

**[00:09 - 00:18]** Him, you church family, we will make love our defining culture. Love in our homes, love

**[00:18 - 00:25]** in our ministries, love in our service, and love in our community. We will not merely

**[00:25 - 00:33]** speak about love, but we will live it out in action and in truth so that the world,

**[00:33 - 00:45]** this world may know that we are His disciples. In 2026, we will walk in on failing love,

**[00:45 - 00:51]** we will receive it from the Father, we will reflect it through the Lord Jesus Christ, and

**[00:51 - 00:59]** we will release it to the world by the power of the Holy Spirit. Welcome to your year of

**[00:59 - 01:10]** unfailing love. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Paola. Amen. Thank you, Father, for our year

**[01:10 - 01:17]** of unfailing love in Jesus' name. Amen. With that having been read, I want to speak to

**[01:17 - 01:27]** us tonight on the subject of unfailing love. Help us understand what it means for us when

**[01:27 - 01:42]** we say, God loves you. What does that really? And to do so, I want you to please turn with me

**[01:42 - 01:56]** to Jeremiah chapter 31. And we're going to read from verse 3, Jeremiah 31, verse 3. Yes, the

**[01:56 - 02:04]** Lord was speaking, and he was speaking to Israel. I have loved you with an everlasting love.

**[02:04 - 02:16]** Therefore, with loving kindness, I have drawn you. Please repeat after me, say, yes, I have loved

**[02:16 - 02:34]** you with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness, I have drawn you. That is God

**[02:34 - 02:43]** speaking to Israel. And the setting, of course, is a time when Israel unfortunately is in rebellion as

**[02:43 - 02:51]** they to often were. And Jeremiah, the Weeping Prophet speaks to them, and he's speaking to a

**[02:51 - 02:59]** nation that because of their rebellion now is experiencing a lot of bad consequences. The walls of

**[02:59 - 03:07]** Jerusalem are broken, the gates are broken, the temple is in ruins, the people themselves are

**[03:07 - 03:14]** displaced. You're not at their homes, they're displaced in the nations. And now the living with

**[03:14 - 03:25]** pain and disappointment and failure and experiencing a measure of God's discipline. So when the

**[03:25 - 03:33]** Lord says these words to them, I have loved you with an everlasting love. It is to a disobedient and

**[03:33 - 03:39]** a rebellious people who are actually reaping the results of their disobedience that he speaks.

**[03:41 - 03:50]** And amazingly, he speaks to them in that condition. And there's not a word of rejection.

**[03:50 - 04:02]** There's not a word I told you so. Instead, he reaches into their situation. And while speaking to

**[04:02 - 04:10]** people who have rebuilt against them and who have committed idolatry, et cetera, he speaks to them.

**[04:10 - 04:23]** And the thing he says to them is, I have loved you. I have loved you. I have loved you with an

**[04:23 - 04:34]** everlasting love. That is, I have always loved you. Always. I have never once stopped loving you.

**[04:35 - 04:43]** In spite of all you did to me, in spite of your rebellion, in spite of your idolatry,

**[04:44 - 04:55]** I have never once stopped loving. Church, let's hear God speaking to us in the same manner

**[04:57 - 05:05]** tonight. And let's hear God speaking to us throughout 2026. Let's hear God saying to us,

**[05:05 - 05:16]** I have loved you with an everlasting love. And I will love you in 2026 with an everlasting love.

**[05:17 - 05:22]** You have not always behaved and you have not always done what you ought to have done.

**[05:23 - 05:31]** And sometimes you were just completely rebellious and disrespectful. But not once did I stop

**[05:31 - 05:41]** loving you because of that. I have loved you with an everlasting love. Raise your hand. I said,

**[05:41 - 05:54]** God, thank you for loving me with an everlasting love. So before God talks to them about obedience

**[05:54 - 06:04]** and restoration, he settles one issue. And this is the issue I have loved you. In this year of

**[06:04 - 06:14]** unfilling love, let's settle that issue. Once and for all, let's settle it. And every day in

**[06:14 - 06:22]** 2026, as we begin each day and as we go through each day, as we face the challenges that 2026 will

**[06:22 - 06:28]** bring, the test and trials that come with living on this light, on this earth. We're going to have

**[06:28 - 06:36]** to get to heaven to get rid of all of that. But hear me. We can go into 2026 with our being afraid.

**[06:38 - 06:50]** If we can truly grasp this revelation and settle the issue that God has loved us and that love

**[06:51 - 07:08]** is regardless. Can we agree church? Can you agree that God has loved you? And he has done so

**[07:08 - 07:17]** regardless. Man, if it wasn't regardless, we wouldn't be here tonight. I know you didn't hear me.

**[07:18 - 07:28]** If it wasn't regardless, none of us would be going into 2026. That's just a fact.

**[07:29 - 07:37]** And if we can settle it in our mind, that is so. We have the foundation upon which we can build

**[07:37 - 07:46]** our lives, upon which we can move forward in 2026, the foundation upon which we can resist the devil.

**[07:47 - 07:58]** In the midst of every test and trial, you and I need to be grounded on this truth. God loves me.

**[07:58 - 08:10]** This love, as we will see, is everlasting. And it is this love that would cure us in the 2026.

**[08:11 - 08:21]** An unfailing love that would punish our fears and make us more than conquerors.

**[08:22 - 08:28]** So let's look more closer. What is the nature of this love? Well, we already used the word

**[08:28 - 08:33]** a few times, but let me just make some comments. The nature of God's unfailing love is that it is what?

**[08:34 - 08:45]** Ever lasting. Jeremiah thought it was three, six, it is ever lasting. And that means it has no

**[08:45 - 08:55]** beginning. It has no starting point. You look back in the eternity as far back as you can go

**[08:56 - 09:06]** and keep going because eternity has no beginning. And one thing will be constant. That throughout

**[09:06 - 09:16]** eternity, both in your past and in eternity, future, one thing is going to be constant. There is no

**[09:16 - 09:33]** variation, no change in that is that God loves you and God loves us. It means that there is no

**[09:33 - 09:46]** time when the love of God takes time off. I know sometimes you think God's love has taken time

**[09:46 - 09:55]** off, but that's just your perception. That's the enemy suggesting a lie to you. But because the love

**[09:55 - 10:03]** of God is ever lasting, God never, his love never takes the vacation. I mean, he was talking to

**[10:03 - 10:07]** these people, these Israelites who were rebellious, who are adulterous. And you would think if there's

**[10:07 - 10:13]** any time that God's love would take a vacation or take some time off, it would be when they are misbehaving

**[10:13 - 10:19]** and rebellious and adulterous, God could say, this is a good time for me to step back and stop loving

**[10:19 - 10:26]** you. Stop caring for you. Stop being concerned for you. Stop helping you. Stop paying attention to

**[10:26 - 10:32]** you. I'm just going to take a vacation and wait until you're ready and then I will come back from

**[10:32 - 10:39]** my vacation and we can resume where I left off. But that's not the way it works. There's no starting

**[10:39 - 10:47]** points. There's no expiration date. There's no time off. There's no vacation. Say hallelujah.

**[10:48 - 11:00]** Raise your hand and say, God, your love never takes a vacation. God's love did not begin when you

**[11:00 - 11:07]** break the service prayer. I know sometimes we think that's when God started to love us, but we've got to

**[11:07 - 11:13]** say, no, no, God loved you before you got saved. If God didn't love you before you got saved,

**[11:13 - 11:21]** you never would have gotten saved. Do you know what he had to do? First of all, to make it possible

**[11:21 - 11:26]** for you to be saved through Jesus Christ. And then you know what he had to do in order to bring you to

**[11:26 - 11:35]** the place where you had enough sense to respond to the gospel, to believe the gospel and be saved.

**[11:36 - 11:45]** My goodness. Thank God. God's love for you did not begin when you prayed the service prayer.

**[11:46 - 11:55]** It started long before you were born because it existed all the way in what eternity passed. Before

**[11:55 - 12:08]** you failed. He loved you. Before your obedience, he loved you because you see his love is not based on

**[12:09 - 12:17]** your performance. His love is not a reaction to what you do because if it was that his love would

**[12:17 - 12:27]** be a roller coaster. Okay. She praised me just now. I love you. She just said something. She

**[12:27 - 12:38]** said she should not have said his love would be a roller coaster. But thank God. In 2026, our year

**[12:38 - 12:43]** I'm feeling love. One thing we're going to know and one thing we're going to be sure of is that the

**[12:43 - 12:53]** love of God is constant. There's nothing you will do and nothing I will do that would diminish God's

**[12:53 - 13:00]** love for you when I hold up. And there's nothing you need to do to increase his love for you because

**[13:00 - 13:09]** his love for you is already perfect. Complete. Thank God for human love. I love the fact that my wife

**[13:09 - 13:16]** loves me. Amen. And you know, I like it when people like me and love me and I'm sure it's the same

**[13:16 - 13:21]** for you. The human love is beautiful, but the problem with human love is that it does have a beginning

**[13:21 - 13:28]** and too often. I've seen two men of folks who came to the altar and said, did that the we part?

**[13:30 - 13:42]** Looked at each other, said publicly with a smile on their face and they were like because as long

**[13:42 - 13:54]** as you keep me happy. So too often human love has an end and we tend to confuse that with God's love.

**[13:59 - 14:09]** No, no, the Bible says this is love. Not that we love God, but that God loved us which means

**[14:09 - 14:21]** he says love was independent of our love. It wasn't quick pro. Hallelujah. God's love you before

**[14:21 - 14:28]** you took your first breath. God's love you God loved you before the foundation of the world.

**[14:29 - 14:41]** So God's love is everlasting. And that means it doesn't fail because you fail. It doesn't waver

**[14:41 - 14:47]** because you waver. A good picture of the love of God is seen in the story of the prodigal son,

**[14:47 - 14:58]** that father who in spite of all that the son did continue to love his son the same. And when the

**[14:58 - 15:04]** son decided to come back, the father didn't wait for him to get home and go through a period of

**[15:04 - 15:11]** long repentance and demonstrate that he was changed or different. The Bible tells us why the boy was

**[15:12 - 15:20]** yet a far away. That means that father every day was looking for his son to come back as that was his

**[15:20 - 15:26]** son. Son don't want he had no business don't misbehaving. Son needing some serious correction,

**[15:26 - 15:31]** but sometimes you know the correction comes in the circumstances. Nobody got to say nothing,

**[15:31 - 15:38]** he got to a place where he had to eat. He had to eat but from the from the pigs, you know food.

**[15:38 - 15:45]** I mean the circumstances themselves brought him to his senses. Father didn't have to say nothing.

**[15:46 - 15:50]** Amen. But you know you don't have to learn that way. You can learn from God's word.

**[15:52 - 15:55]** I mean there's just a lot of wisdom in the word of God because he loves you. He's put a lot of

**[15:55 - 16:00]** wisdom in his word. And you and I can just learn a lot about his wisdom from his word. How to live,

**[16:00 - 16:06]** how to treat one another, want to do what not to do. You don't have to go to the point where you

**[16:06 - 16:14]** about to eat from the pig's pile for you to come to your senses. Come to your senses tonight.

**[16:17 - 16:22]** Hey hear me? If you haven't come to your senses yet, come to your senses tonight.

**[16:24 - 16:29]** What's the system you come to to the realization that God loves you with an everlasting love and the

**[16:29 - 16:36]** best thing that can happen to you is to be loved by God. When the boy came to his senses he said,

**[16:36 - 16:43]** what am I doing here? Even the servants in my father's house have enough to eat and to spare.

**[16:44 - 16:50]** It will be better for me to be a servant in my father's house to be here acting up.

**[16:52 - 16:58]** And father didn't wait for the boy to come home. When he saw him afar off, he literally ran to him.

**[16:58 - 17:04]** The boy was dirty. He was smelling. He smelled like pigs. He looked probably like

**[17:05 - 17:10]** like pigs. It didn't matter to the father because the father's love was not based upon the son.

**[17:10 - 17:16]** The father loved him because he was a father. Are you hear me? And we need to understand that God's

**[17:16 - 17:22]** love for us comes from God's nature. God loves us because that's who God is. God is love.

**[17:23 - 17:29]** And so God's love is not a reaction to your behavior, my behavior. God's love comes from who God

**[17:30 - 17:36]** is. Say hallelujah. So God's love flows from His very nature. First John chapter 4 verse 8 says

**[17:37 - 17:50]** that God is love, our year. In 2026 in this year of unfeeling love, enter that year

**[17:51 - 17:56]** and go through that year. No matter what you face, no matter what test and they will come.

**[17:57 - 18:03]** Temptation will come. Tries will come. So we shouldn't even say what God loves us but.

**[18:04 - 18:13]** No, no. God loves us and. Are you hear me? Thank God he loves you because those

**[18:13 - 18:20]** trials are going to come whether he loves you or not. But because he loves you, you will be able to

**[18:20 - 18:26]** go and the Bible says that we'll get to that. In all of these things, it is his love that makes

**[18:26 - 18:37]** us more than conquerors. The love of God is for us and the love of God will empower us and

**[18:37 - 18:44]** grace us and supply everything we need to go into the trial and to come out of the trial.

**[18:46 - 18:55]** More than conquerors. The love of God will make us victorious in every test, in every trial

**[18:55 - 19:04]** because the love of God is unfeeling. I hear me. So don't say what God loves me but

**[19:05 - 19:13]** say they're trials and I hear me because it is the love of God that will make the difference.

**[19:15 - 19:23]** Am I communicating? Am I helping you? Yes, the second thing very quickly that I'm not able

**[19:23 - 19:29]** to see how much time I have so I don't know why I'm not seeing the time here. But the love of God

**[19:29 - 19:35]** according to the same Jeremiah, he says therefore with loving kindness I have what?

**[19:36 - 19:48]** Therefore with loving kindness I have. So God's love is described as loving kindness and loving

**[19:48 - 19:59]** kindness causes God to draw you. So that word loving kindness speaks of a covenant love

**[20:00 - 20:09]** that exists between us and God based upon the fact that God's love is everlasting. That word loving

**[20:09 - 20:20]** kindness describes a love that is not just a passive sentiment. It is not just a good feeling that

**[20:20 - 20:30]** God has about you. Oh, I love you. That means I feel I got some feelings. It's not just a mental

**[20:30 - 20:46]** acceptance of you. The word loving kindness speaks of a love that acts. It is a love that draws.

**[20:46 - 20:53]** It is a love that takes action. It is a love that gives. It's a love that provides. It's a love

**[20:53 - 21:03]** that protects. It is not passive. It is a love that acts on behalf of the one loved.

**[21:05 - 21:12]** And so when we speak of God's love being everlasting and we prepare to go into 2026,

**[21:12 - 21:17]** ground it in the revelation of that love. Let us understand that the love we're talking about is

**[21:17 - 21:23]** not just a good feeling. God is not just going to feel good about you. God is not just going to

**[21:23 - 21:28]** have some good mental thoughts. It means that God is going to take concrete action.

**[21:29 - 21:37]** God is going to take action. God is going to do what God needs to do in order to help you.

**[21:37 - 21:44]** God is not going to stand by and just let you have to suffer and go through stuff. He says,

**[21:44 - 21:52]** watching and say, hey, I love her. No. When God says I love you, God needs I am going to take action.

**[21:55 - 22:01]** I don't know what it matters to you, but I'm glad that when I go to 2026 and I face the test and I

**[22:01 - 22:06]** face the trials and I face the demons and I face the devil, I don't have to be afraid of them

**[22:06 - 22:13]** because I know that God loves me with an everlasting love. And this is a love that will

**[22:13 - 22:18]** compel God to take action. That God is not just going to sit down when I feel sorry for me.

**[22:18 - 22:25]** God is not going to simply be passive. No. God is going to act. God is going to move.

**[22:25 - 22:29]** God is going to hear praying. God is going to provide. God is going to intervene. God is going to

**[22:29 - 22:35]** step into the fire. Are you hear me with me and even though the fire is seven times harder than

**[22:35 - 22:41]** usual, his presence in me, his loving kindness is going to preserve me. And I will come out of the

**[22:41 - 22:48]** fire and the smoke will not be on on me because why? God did not just stand by and watch me.

**[22:48 - 22:55]** Yeah, I'm in the fire. Yeah, the fire is hot. But God is in it with me. And when God is in the fire,

**[22:55 - 23:02]** it makes all the difference. So don't go into 2026 saying that there will be no fire. You'll be

**[23:02 - 23:10]** disappointed. There will be fire. But go that knowing that God is going in it with you and God

**[23:10 - 23:24]** will not be passive. Amen? God's love for you will move God to act. For God's love is action.

**[23:25 - 23:36]** Remember the Bible says, if you see someone who's hungry or someone who is cold, he says,

**[23:36 - 23:48]** if you just say to them, be fed. But you don't do anything in order to feed them. Or you say to

**[23:48 - 23:56]** them on this cold night, be warm. But you do nothing to help provide them with clothing. The

**[23:56 - 24:05]** question is how then does the love of God dwell in you? In other words, that is not the love of God.

**[24:06 - 24:17]** God's love will never reduce, be reduced of mere words and sympathy. That is not the way God loves.

**[24:17 - 24:23]** God will never look at you and simply say, well, I hope you make it do your best. No, if God

**[24:23 - 24:30]** says to you, when you see someone who's hungry, do something if you can. If you see someone who's

**[24:30 - 24:39]** cold, do something if you can. That means that God will always act when he sees a need. He will

**[24:39 - 24:49]** always offer the help required. God will never, never say to someone he loves. Okay, hope you make

**[24:49 - 25:00]** it. I wish I were helping you. Because you will face challenges and you need to face challenges

**[25:00 - 25:07]** knowing that God is not just going to sit there and say, I love you. No, when God says, I love you,

**[25:07 - 25:18]** God means I am going to act. I'm going to help you. I'm going to work with you. I'm going to do

**[25:18 - 25:28]** something about this. Relay on me. Trust me. Work with me. I will help you. You will not go through

**[25:28 - 25:36]** this alone. I will not forsake you. I will not lead this to you, to you to handle by yourself.

**[25:42 - 25:57]** And somebody said, God and you are always a majority. Hallelujah. And that's why by the time we get

**[25:57 - 26:02]** to Romans 80 and that's what we're going to close when we get to Romans 8. By the time we get to

**[26:02 - 26:19]** Romans 8, the question is asked by the apostle Paul, what can separate us? I'm going to 2026 knowing

**[26:19 - 26:29]** nothing can separate me from the love of God. And that's huge. That's huge. Say hallelujah.

**[26:29 - 26:34]** So let me give you a testimony. Again, just to let you know, because I want you to understand

**[26:35 - 26:40]** when the Bible says his love and kindness have drawn you, it's saying that God is going to act.

**[26:41 - 26:48]** God is not simply going to be passive. This love is a love that moves on behalf of us.

**[26:49 - 26:53]** And I'm learning that the only thing that limits that love is our unbelief.

**[26:53 - 27:05]** The problem is not God's reluctance, because God is always posed a poised to help. That's his nature.

**[27:06 - 27:12]** In fact, let me say this way before I give you this illustrate. That's who God is. God is love.

**[27:12 - 27:27]** And love by definition acts, helps and gives. God is love. And the love of God is so strong. The love of

**[27:27 - 27:43]** God is so great for me. That God's love will not permit God. Not to help. God cannot look at me in my

**[27:43 - 27:56]** situation and not help. He said, why? Because God is love. And the nature of love is loving

**[27:56 - 28:06]** kindness. So God is love and love acts. I say this way. Sometimes I'm struggling because I don't want

**[28:06 - 28:12]** to sound irreverent. But I started to talk to God that way. I know my father understands.

**[28:13 - 28:18]** I need to hear myself say to him. He's okay. But I said to God, you cannot not help me.

**[28:20 - 28:25]** It's not possible. Your love for me is too strong. Your love for me is too great.

**[28:25 - 28:32]** You cannot not. You can't help yourself. God, you are a prisoner of your love.

**[28:34 - 28:40]** Again, I understand. It's not between me and God. And man, he doesn't take it as disrespect.

**[28:40 - 28:45]** But that's a fact. God cannot not help me.

**[28:46 - 28:53]** Now, I cannot receive the help. And that's the unbelief. And the unbelief is because we don't know

**[28:53 - 28:58]** the love of God as we should. But if we grow in the revelation of the love of God, and that's my

**[28:58 - 29:03]** prayer, that in 2026, we're going to grow in the revelation of his love. We would get to the

**[29:03 - 29:10]** place where we say, you know what? I'm not going to worry. I'm not going to be ashes. I'm not

**[29:10 - 29:20]** going to be afraid because of the situation because God cannot help himself. He got to help me

**[29:22 - 29:32]** because that's who he is. Say, God is love. And God cannot cease to be God. Therefore God

**[29:32 - 29:43]** cannot cease to be love. And love acts on behalf of the one who loves. So God cannot not help me

**[29:43 - 29:51]** because God has loved me with an everlasting love. Now, you can take that. I hope you can say it

**[29:51 - 29:56]** for yourself because that's why you need to get to. That's what all of us need to get to.

**[29:56 - 30:04]** Well, we can say God cannot not help me because God is love. And God did not cease to be God.

**[30:04 - 30:10]** Therefore God did not cease to be love. Oh my goodness. Let me ask you a question. Are your

**[30:10 - 30:24]** human being? Can you cease to be a human being? You cannot. Well, God is God. And God is love. God

**[30:24 - 30:29]** cannot cease to be God. But for him to be God, he has to be love. He cannot cease to be love.

**[30:29 - 30:39]** He cannot not help me because he loves me with an everlasting love. Amen. So I don't know about

**[30:39 - 30:45]** you, but in 2026, I plan to keep reminding God every problem, every challenge, every test. I

**[30:45 - 30:53]** was a God. I know you love and you love those everlasting love. So you got no way out of this one.

**[30:55 - 31:00]** Now, I'm not saying he wants to get out. You understand? But it's for my benefit. You got no way

**[31:00 - 31:10]** to get out of this. You just can't. And he just so he likes that because the father delights

**[31:10 - 31:16]** in blessing his children. Are you hear me? So once again, let me repeat you, when the Bible says

**[31:16 - 31:22]** God loves you with an everlasting love, that love is a love that acts. We're not talking about

**[31:22 - 31:28]** passion and passivity. We're not talking about feelings. We're talking about action. God for

**[31:28 - 31:36]** God to love the world. He gave action. So recently, I'm putting the practice what I'm preaching

**[31:36 - 31:40]** for myself. You know, we got to believe God and trust God for different things, the needs of

**[31:40 - 31:47]** the ministry. And one of the things we're doing has to do with the building of the university,

**[31:47 - 31:52]** cost money to do that. And you know, we're not at the place where we have enough students yet

**[31:52 - 31:59]** to be able to cover the cost. So there's a gap between tuition and the cost. And since I am

**[31:59 - 32:08]** quote unquote the visionary, they call me that. I guess, in principle, carry the responsibility

**[32:08 - 32:14]** to make sure that that gap is fulfilled. But I was getting to the place where I thought was my

**[32:14 - 32:23]** responsibility. I had to remind myself, no, no, no, no. He's the one who told me to do this. So

**[32:23 - 32:33]** this is his work. I hear me. And when I started to act as though I was responsible, the Holy

**[32:33 - 32:48]** Ghost spoke to me and said, who told you that God needs you to support him? Who told you that God

**[32:48 - 32:58]** is depending upon you to support him? You need him to support you. Look, Jesus took five

**[32:58 - 33:08]** loads and two fish. And that over five thousand men plus women and children somehow God was able

**[33:08 - 33:21]** to take care of that. So I was in the situation where we needed $10,000. And I was scratching my head.

**[33:23 - 33:32]** I got a little money in the bank. And I've used some before to help. And I was scratching my head.

**[33:32 - 33:37]** That's when he said, who told you you the one supposed to support me? So I said, you know what God,

**[33:37 - 33:43]** I'm not worrying about this at all. You cannot not help me. And you cannot not do this work. So I

**[33:43 - 33:47]** just stop worrying, start giving God thanks. And then you know what happened this past week?

**[33:48 - 33:56]** One of our young, young members who's left see those, she's somewhere else, came and found me

**[33:56 - 34:04]** and brought an envelope. And she said, I just wanted to come and say thank you. Thank you for all

**[34:04 - 34:10]** that this church has meant and this minister has meant and you have meant. And so she gave me this

**[34:10 - 34:20]** envelope. I was putting in my pocket. She said, no, open it. Now this was not anybody. My mind would have

**[34:20 - 34:31]** ever thought about in the situation. But I don't support God. God knows how to take care of his own

**[34:31 - 34:41]** business. I hear me and love me. He's going to act. And she she handed me the envelope and I opened

**[34:42 - 34:52]** it and $20,000. That's more than enough at least a couple of this month and next month.

**[34:54 - 35:00]** Hey man, so God has sent you at least two months and you know what? I give you that example because

**[35:00 - 35:07]** that's the kind of love that is going into. You're taking that kind of love into 2026.

**[35:07 - 35:14]** Hey man, you're going to see that kind of love working in your life when you rely on his love and

**[35:14 - 35:20]** you know his love and you trust his love and you know the power of his love. That's the kind of

**[35:20 - 35:31]** love that you will be experiencing in 2026. Say hallelujah. It's going to be concrete. It's going to

**[35:31 - 35:37]** be practical. It's going to be substantial. It's going to be evidential. It's going to solve problems.

**[35:38 - 35:43]** It will be the answer to need. It will be the answer to prayers. Are you listening to me?

**[35:43 - 35:52]** Say hallelujah. Amen. All of the requirements that we would know and believe the love that God

**[35:52 - 36:01]** has for us so we can rest in it. Some of you have heard of George Mueller and he had this

**[36:01 - 36:08]** orphanage and there's books of so many answers to pray how you they would need and I'm working in

**[36:08 - 36:17]** that. It's the same love. I can write my book and talk about how $20,000 showed up from nowhere.

**[36:19 - 36:25]** From my God already had it paid platform and I'm going to have many stories. I already got some

**[36:25 - 36:35]** but I'm declaring my stories will multiply. Acts were nationaled in 2026. Why? Because this love

**[36:35 - 36:45]** is everlasting and I'm going into 2026 with this love leading the way and I'm challenging you

**[36:45 - 36:52]** and I'm encouraging you that you were going to 2026 with this love on your mind with this love

**[36:52 - 36:59]** in your heart with this love in your mouth that you are going to 2026 and face every test every

**[36:59 - 37:08]** challenge on the foundation that God has loved me with an everlasting love and that love

**[37:09 - 37:14]** will never take efficacious and if God is loving me then God is acting on my behalf.

**[37:15 - 37:24]** So I will not be afraid I would trust, rely on, believe the love of God like first John

**[37:24 - 37:35]** tells us to do. Let me bring this quickly to a close. Turn to Romans chapter 8. Are you here?

**[37:35 - 37:42]** So here is my call to action for me and for you for all of us. Let's go into 2026.

**[37:43 - 37:55]** Convince persuaded absolutely persuaded that there's nothing that will separate us from the love of

**[37:55 - 38:02]** God. Let me tell you what that means. It means there's nothing that will stop God from loving you.

**[38:07 - 38:19]** Go into 2026. Convince. Nothing. Absolutely nothing will stop God from loving me and

**[38:19 - 38:28]** understand that love is not a feeling. Love is action on your behalf. Nothing will separate me. Say

**[38:28 - 38:40]** nothing will separate me from the love of God in 2026 and beyond. Say nothing will stop God

**[38:41 - 38:49]** from blessing me and loving me and meeting my needs and giving me strength and giving me victory

**[38:49 - 38:59]** in 2026. Absolutely nothing. Nothing will separate me. Nothing will stop me and listen to this.

**[38:59 - 39:09]** It means nothing can undo what his love has already done. The scriptures in Romans 8 says nothing

**[39:09 - 39:16]** can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus concerning us. So what that means is

**[39:16 - 39:21]** all that God has already done because when my love is action it's not just thoughts. All that the

**[39:21 - 39:34]** love of God has already accomplished for us in Christ. There's nothing that can undo it and if you

**[39:34 - 39:43]** look at Romans 8 and you saw that verse 31, Paul begins to ask questions. He says what shall we say

**[39:43 - 39:54]** concerning all these things. If God before us, IE, if God loves you, that's what it means. If God

**[39:54 - 40:04]** that's what you mean, if God loves you, what shall, what's the question, what's the first question?

**[40:05 - 40:15]** What shall we say to these things? If God before us, if God loves us, who can be against us and win?

**[40:15 - 40:24]** He's not saying you have a lot of things against you. So don't be surprised with the stuff that will

**[40:24 - 40:37]** be against you, but your attitude should be, if God is for me or if God loves me because that's

**[40:37 - 40:48]** what it means for God to love your means is for you. Who can be, what can be against you and win?

**[40:49 - 40:55]** Why? Because anything that comes against you will have to deal with the love of God for you.

**[40:55 - 41:08]** If it has to overcome the love of God, it cannot win because it has to win against the love of God.

**[41:08 - 41:16]** But the love of God is the most powerful force in the universe. Why do I say that?

**[41:16 - 41:22]** Because Paul asks the question, why just separate us from the love of God and then he says,

**[41:22 - 41:37]** son, death, come on and the answer is no. So if death cannot undo what the love of God has done.

**[41:37 - 41:46]** Then the love of God is more powerful than death. Here is the proof that Jesus loves you

**[41:46 - 42:01]** the cross. You know what? You and I need to stop asking the question, does God love me?

**[42:02 - 42:10]** Does Jesus love me? Stop it. Stop asking the question whether he loves me as much as he loves so

**[42:10 - 42:19]** so. Stop it. Why should you stop it? Because God has answered that question convincingly.

**[42:19 - 42:28]** If you doubt that God loves you, look at the cross. Because God didn't just say it, he demonstrated.

**[42:29 - 42:37]** Amen. God commanded us love for us in the way we were yesterday. Christ died. So God didn't just say

**[42:37 - 42:47]** I love you. God demonstrated. He loves you. E-E-E, everlasting. But what he did on the cross. Look at

**[42:47 - 43:01]** the cross. Look at the nails. What do they say? I'm failing love everlasting love. Look at the

**[43:01 - 43:10]** crown of thorns. That's God's answer to the question. Whether he loves you. What does it say

**[43:10 - 43:23]** unfailing love? Look at the blood that Jesus shed. What does it say unfailing love? So the question

**[43:23 - 43:31]** whether he loves you or not has been answered. Don't raise that question again. And every time it comes

**[43:31 - 43:38]** to your mind, recognize it's the devil trying to limit you. Yeah, the devil is trying to limit you.

**[43:38 - 43:43]** The devil is trying to limit you. The devil is trying to limit you because he knows if you truly

**[43:43 - 43:49]** embrace the revelation of the love of God and you build your life on that love, nothing shall be

**[43:49 - 43:56]** impossible to you. I'm telling you something. God didn't just say I love you. He said it but

**[43:56 - 44:03]** beyond that he proved it on the cross by accepting his son who died on the cross for you.

**[44:05 - 44:15]** And so the question Paul asked to give us if he did not swear, did not withhold his son Jesus

**[44:15 - 44:24]** from you. What shall he with Jesus with hold from you? And what's the answer? Judge, I'm asking

**[44:24 - 44:31]** your question. If he did not swear Jesus, what will he withhold from you? Come on say nothing.

**[44:32 - 44:41]** Say nothing. How can God give Jesus his full of begotten son and then withhold from you the

**[44:41 - 44:48]** things you need? It is completely illogical. It's a crazy man who will give his son for someone

**[44:48 - 44:54]** and then refuse to give these lesser things that mean nothing to him. God doesn't need money.

**[44:54 - 45:00]** Why can't he give it to you? He doesn't need houses, he doesn't need labs, he doesn't need clothes,

**[45:00 - 45:05]** he doesn't need food. He will miss none of those things and one of the things that he valued

**[45:06 - 45:12]** and was a treasure that he loved was his only begotten son and that he was willing to give his son

**[45:12 - 45:19]** because of you and me, my goodness, what kind of love is that? What man of love is this?

**[45:23 - 45:28]** So don't ask that question, some questions, some questions, some wondering, it's such a going

**[45:28 - 45:35]** to 2026. Every day reminding yourself that when it comes to love, it is such a God loves me as much

**[45:35 - 45:42]** as he loves Jesus. And again, for my benefit, I could almost say he loved me more than he loved

**[45:42 - 45:51]** Jesus because he gave Jesus, for me, that God, God can do both of those things, but it's one

**[45:51 - 45:59]** of my benefit. If I give something for something else, it means what I am getting for what I'm

**[45:59 - 46:08]** giving is more valuable to me. How then can you doubt God's love for you? How can you question

**[46:08 - 46:16]** the value of your life? How can you question what you mean to God when God was willing to give

**[46:16 - 46:24]** Jesus in exchange for you? Here, take Jesus, let me have you. And then you have the decency to

**[46:24 - 46:32]** do with all yourself. Come on, God did that for you. And instead of opening your arms

**[46:33 - 46:41]** and say, let me hug you. Let me embrace you. I love you. Here I am, you're the best thing

**[46:41 - 46:45]** that ever happened to me. After giving his son for you, someone got to stand here and try to

**[46:45 - 46:57]** convince you still. Are you listening? So the cross, where am I? Where am I with the time, guys?

**[46:57 - 47:06]** The cross proves his love and the resurrection demonstrates that the love has the power,

**[47:06 - 47:15]** the love of God is strong enough to meet every need you have because there's no power strong enough

**[47:15 - 47:22]** to withstand the love. How do I know that death could not keep love in the ground?

**[47:22 - 47:29]** The love of God overcame the power of death, resurrected in order to give you life.

**[47:31 - 47:38]** If the death, if death, could not keep him, keep his love from resurrecting so that you can have

**[47:38 - 47:46]** life, then both said, I am convinced. I am full of persuaded that there is nothing in heaven

**[47:47 - 47:58]** or in earth, not angels, not principalities, not life, not death, not things above,

**[47:59 - 48:10]** not things beneath. I am convinced, Paul, absolutely nothing created can separate me from

**[48:10 - 48:18]** what the love of God has accomplished for me and what the love of God will do for me. There is no

**[48:18 - 48:25]** other force, there is no spiritual force, there's nothing in all of creation that is strong enough

**[48:25 - 48:34]** to overpower the love of God that is at work for me and in me and that will be working for you

**[48:34 - 48:50]** in 2026. Said absolutely nothing. That's going to 2026 as more than a conqueror's. That's

**[48:50 - 48:59]** why Paul said, Romans, I am convinced in all of these things we are what more than conqueror's

**[48:59 - 49:13]** through him who loved us. It is the love of God for you and it says revelation of God's love,

**[49:13 - 49:21]** that is invincible. That causes Paul to say, based on the knowledge of that love, we are more than

**[49:21 - 49:26]** conqueror's because when you are more than conqueror's it means that battle has already been fought,

**[49:26 - 49:31]** the victory is already won, the thing has already been accomplished and in this case we know all

**[49:31 - 49:37]** of that was accomplished by the love of God, reflected and manifested in Christ Jesus. Now you are

**[49:37 - 49:48]** more than conqueror because love has already conquered. I am declaring over you every test, every devil,

**[49:48 - 49:56]** every demon, every principality that shows up in 2026, you need to look at and say the love of God

**[49:56 - 50:03]** has already conquered you and my attitude towards you is simpler this I am more than a conqueror.

**[50:03 - 50:11]** I'm not going to waste any time on you because the love of God already overcame you.

**[50:11 - 50:18]** I'm going to walk in the victory which the love of God has already obtained. Are you listening

**[50:18 - 50:26]** to me? Hear me! There is nothing in heaven, no principles, no demons, nothing created,

**[50:26 - 50:30]** that would be able to undo what the love of God in Christ has already accomplished.

**[50:30 - 50:37]** What has this love accomplished? Paul says in Romans 8 a little bit earlier, just before Romans 831,

**[50:37 - 50:46]** Paul says, whomever he for new, he predestined to be conformed to the image of Jesus,

**[50:46 - 50:53]** and whomever he predestined he called, and whomever he called he justified, and whomever he

**[50:53 - 50:59]** justified, he glorified. So the love of God in Christ has already called you,

**[51:00 - 51:06]** justified you, glorified you, and that Paul said, what should we say to these things? In other

**[51:06 - 51:12]** words, if the love of God has already accomplished these things to you, there's nothing that can undo it.

**[51:14 - 51:20]** Nothing that will undo your glorification, it's done. The love of God has accomplished if nothing

**[51:20 - 51:27]** can undo it. Nothing can undo your justification, your righteousness and God's sight. Are you hear me?

**[51:27 - 51:32]** And there's nothing in heaven or earth that will undo it, because the love of God has accomplished it.

**[51:32 - 51:39]** Nothing will undo the call. Are you hear me? I don't care what the enemy has done or planned,

**[51:39 - 51:46]** those things are done, and there's no power that can undo that for you or me. So I'm going

**[51:46 - 51:54]** into 2006 more than a conqueror, because I know I've been called by the love of God. I've been

**[51:54 - 52:01]** justified by the love of God. I've been glorified by the love of God, and there's nothing in heaven

**[52:01 - 52:06]** or earth that can change my position or change my status. That is where I am. That is where I stand.

**[52:06 - 52:11]** It is from that place that I will live. It is from that place that I will pray, and it is from

**[52:11 - 52:21]** that place that I will enforce the devil's defeat. I will not fight for victory because the love of

**[52:21 - 52:29]** God already secured the victory. I will stand in the victory, which the love of God has accomplished,

**[52:29 - 52:33]** and I will say to every devil, I will say to every demon, I will say to every person,

**[52:34 - 52:38]** I will say to every devil, I will say to every trouble, I will say to every sound.

**[52:41 - 53:05]** In Christ, more than a conqueror. Stand to your feet. Come on. Raise your hand. Many of you here

**[53:06 - 53:20]** are already the children of God. My prayer for you is that you will embrace this revelation concerning

**[53:20 - 53:28]** the unfilling love of God, and through our 226, 2026, you will grow increasingly in that revelation.

**[53:29 - 53:35]** And as you do so, this is what Paul said, you will be filled with the fullness of God.

**[53:36 - 53:43]** Are you hear me? Now, when you receive that love, you are then to reflect that love. How can you

**[53:43 - 53:51]** receive this kind of love and not reflect it? So let that love that you have received from him,

**[53:52 - 53:59]** flow in you, and then flow through you back to those that you know, and those that you

**[53:59 - 54:05]** are at fellowship with their interaction with their living with here at this church in your home,

**[54:05 - 54:12]** wherever you are, believe the love that God has for you, and then allow that same love to flow

**[54:12 - 54:18]** under your hearts, out of your mouth, out of your life to others so that through you others can come

**[54:18 - 54:26]** to know this same love that has changed you in Jesus name. Brothers, let us love one another

**[54:27 - 54:42]** for love is of God, and he that love it, know it, God, for God is love. Come and say that, for God is

**[54:42 - 54:49]** love. So may God's love flow in you and flow through me in 2026, but there are some here

**[54:50 - 54:59]** who have been deceived by the enemy. And for that reason, you have not yet received Jesus Christ,

**[54:59 - 55:05]** and the love of God that is in Christ has not yet touched you and transformed you because

**[55:05 - 55:13]** for one reason or the other, you have come to believe that you are not worthy, that you must

**[55:13 - 55:20]** earn it, that you must be able to produce righteousness, and all of those things have kept you

**[55:20 - 55:28]** from receiving the love of God, and allow the love of God to transform you from the inside out.

**[55:28 - 55:35]** Listen to me, I'm about to give an alter call. This alter call is for the man, the woman who's here,

**[55:36 - 55:46]** and who says, the shepherd, I need to respond to this message. I need to receive Jesus Christ,

**[55:46 - 55:53]** in whom the love of God abides. I need to receive this love from God, which comes through Christ.

**[55:54 - 56:04]** I need to receive Jesus tonight as my Savior and as my Lord. I need to start to grow from that

**[56:05 - 56:13]** to know this love that passeth understanding, but I must start tonight when receiving this love.

**[56:13 - 56:20]** You see, God gave Jesus because He loved you, but that's what He had to do,

**[56:21 - 56:32]** what He cannot do for you is to receive Jesus for you. That you have to do. This alter is

**[56:32 - 56:40]** that for perfect people tonight. That's done. This alter is for humble people,

**[56:43 - 56:48]** humble people, not perfect people, humble people who say, I need Jesus.

**[56:51 - 56:55]** I haven't received Christ as my say. I know about it, but I have not received it. I haven't

**[56:55 - 56:59]** repented of sins and received things as my love and Savior. So I really don't know much about

**[56:59 - 57:05]** this love you're talking about. I want to receive the Savior tonight. This alter is not for perfect

**[57:05 - 57:10]** people. This alter is not for people who are promising they will be perfect after they come.

**[57:10 - 57:16]** This you're not going to be Christ as the one who changes you. This alter tonight is for the

**[57:16 - 57:22]** humble man, the humble woman who will come and say, Jesus, I cannot save myself. Jesus, I'm a sinner.

**[57:22 - 57:29]** Jesus, I need the salvation that only you can give. Jesus, I need that love that I heard about tonight.

**[57:30 - 57:37]** That is the person for whom this alter is designed. And if you will come tonight in response

**[57:37 - 57:42]** to this invitation, I promise you, I promise you because of the love of God and because of

**[57:42 - 57:52]** what Christ has already done, all of your sins will be forgiven. Every single one, that's what

**[57:52 - 57:58]** love does. And you will stand before God tonight for the first time ever in your life, holy.

**[57:59 - 58:11]** And blameless in his sight. Is that something you need who will pray for you? And tonight,

**[58:12 - 58:18]** your sins are going to be removed. Tonight for the first time, you're going to receive the life

**[58:18 - 58:25]** of God inside of you. And tonight for the first time, you will be righteous and holy in God's

**[58:26 - 58:32]** sight. It's what the humble man is. Is there a humble person here? Is there a humble woman here?

**[58:32 - 58:38]** As the praise team leads us, I want you who want to pray. Now, you may say, Bishop, I receive Christ,

**[58:38 - 58:44]** but I'm excellent. But tonight, during the worship or during the word, my heart was moved. I need to

**[58:44 - 58:52]** re-dedicate my rights to Jesus. You can come to Him in Jesus name. Or you may say, Bishop, I need to be

**[58:52 - 58:57]** a part of this church. I believe that in this church, I will grow and I want to be a member,

**[58:57 - 59:03]** I want you to come to. So come. If you're humbly enough to admit your need, come. If you're humbly

**[59:03 - 59:08]** enough to say, I'm excellent, I need to be restored. Come. If you're humbly enough to say, I need

**[59:08 - 59:13]** a church like this to help me grow. Come. I'm going to ask some of the pastors to come very quickly.

**[59:13 - 59:26]** Let's say and then you stop making a way to the front quickly, please. We need prayer for salvation,

**[59:26 - 59:36]** come quickly. We don't have a lot of time. If you need to re-dedicate your life, come quickly to express

**[59:36 - 59:42]** your desire to be a member of this church, come very quickly. The rest of you, be praying for them.

**[59:42 - 59:57]** Christ, you've got to humble yourself in God before I took a-

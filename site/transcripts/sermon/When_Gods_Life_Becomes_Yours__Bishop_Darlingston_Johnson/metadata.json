  "sermon_summary": "Bishop Johnson teaches on eternal life (Zoe) as the source of believers' capacity to love and live as God intends. He distinguishes between biological life (Bios) and eternal life (Zoe), explaining that eternal life is not a future promise but a present reality - the very life of Christ dwelling in believers' spirits. This life provides supernatural power to love, believe, and obey as Christ did, closing the gap between how we know we should live and how we actually live.",

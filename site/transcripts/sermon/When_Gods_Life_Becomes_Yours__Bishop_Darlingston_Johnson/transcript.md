## Sermon Theme
The sermon focuses on understanding eternal life (Zoe) as the source of capacity to love and live as God intends. Bishop Johnson distinguishes between biological life (Bios) and eternal life (Zoe), explaining that eternal life is not a future promise but a present reality - the very life of Christ dwelling in believers' spirits, providing the power to love, believe, and obey as Christ did.

## Key Points
1. There is a gap between how we live and how we know we should live
2. The capacity to love as God loves comes from eternal life (Zoe), not human effort
3. Eternal life is a present possession, not a future hope
4. Eternal life is Christ's life in us, energizing our spirits to function as God designed
5. Christianity is participating in the very life of God, not just following religious rules
6. God doesn't improve our human nature; He replaces it with His own life

## Transcript

Father, we thank you for the minutes of the Holy Spirit here this morning. We thank you that he works powerfully in us according to your Word to give utterance and understanding of Jesus to your people. We rejoice in Him and we thank you in Jesus' name. You know, I just love it to see people come to church regardless of the weather. I mean, it's not cold enough, it's not cold enough and it's not snowy. That weather is really for anybody to have used that. I don't know. But if anybody used that as an excuse not to come to worship the day, I've got to keep praying for you. Amen. But we're here. Jesus is here. The Holy Ghost is here. Amen. I don't know how many of you are multi-millionaires yet, but may God make you so. But assuming you are not one yet, and assuming right now you have really very little money, if I were to tell you to go and buy a million-dollar house and I don't give you the funds, assuming I'm able to, that command will become a burden. It's going to be too hard to fulfill if you're trying to fulfill it. It will become a source of frustration and leave you with a sense of failure. Not so. The harder you try to do it, the more frustrating it will become. The heavier the burden will be, the less happy it will be. And of course, you're not able to enjoy the house you already have. Now, that's similar for many of us. There's a gap between how we live and how we know we should live. There's a gap between how we love and how we know God wants us to love. So we read the scriptures and we hear the commands of scriptures, love your enemies. That's what God wants. That's what you want to do. But you said me, love him. After what he did to me, and there's a gap between what God wants you to do, even what you may want to do because you want to please God. And being able to do it. Some of us don't even try. Some of us try and fail. And it leaves us feeling condemned. It leaves us feeling that failures. There's a gap, the command, forgive what another, even as Christ has forgiven you. That's scripture. That is undoubtedly God's will for every single one of us to forgive one another, which means we will offend one another. But destruction is go ahead and forgive one another. And so we know what God has commanded and then we know how we struggle with that. And there's this gap that exists. We end up treating God's commands or instructions in scriptures, in scripture like we do with New Year resolutions. And man, God says, what gave you? Is that I'm going to do it? I'm going to do my best to forgive. I'm going to do my best to serve. I'm going to do my best to love so and so we try. And like most New Year's resolutions, we fall short with fail and then that can lead again to this sense of condemnation, fill your guilt. It doesn't help us with our relationship with God. And it doesn't help us with our relationship with people. That condemnation, that guilt, that sense of failure and frustration. So there's a problem. There's a gap there and here's a problem. We often hear the command to love one another as Christ loves us without understanding why we can. We don't understand why it's possible. And we don't understand how that can become possible in our case. So where do we get the capacity to love like God wants? How do we close the gap between what we know God wants us to do regarding love and our current experience of that in our walk? May I have some water please? So here's the answer. We get this capacity to love like God wants us to love from God himself. Go ahead and tell the person next to you. We get this capacity. You don't know the rest of it. I gotta tell you. Amen. I'm in need to keep this year. We get this capacity to love as God loves us or as Christ loves us from God himself. But in particular, we get this from the gift of eternal life which we received at salvation. Marypeep, we get this capacity to do what God says. So love one another as Christ loves us from God himself. But in particular, from the gift of eternal life which we received which God gave to every one of us who believed in Jesus at salvation. So let's begin by discussing the doctrine of eternal life. Say the neighbour, we will discuss and we will understand better what the gift of eternal life is all about. Because you see the capacity to love comes from the gift of eternal life which you have dwelling inside of you right now. So you're equipped. God has equipped you. God has equipped me. There are two kinds of life the Bible speaks of. One is what we all know, the Greek word is Bios and it's our biological life. It speaks of the natural life that all of us experience as human beings, as every human being who's alive possesses this natural life. This biological life is the source of the energy that the physical body uses to function. Amen. Your physical body is functioning because biological life is energizing it. So the energy your body needs to do what the body is created to do is what we call biological life. Just like your car needs gasoline to run the airplane needs jet fuel to fly, your physical body needs biological life, energy to function and do everything it does. When that life departs, that body can no longer function. But when the life is present, the body can function. All right? So the biological life is that we scientist study and they know a lot about it. They know how it functions. They know the laws that govern it. And they're able to use their knowledge of biological life to get a lot of results positively. That's good. But there's another life that the scientists know nothing about. No seriously now, you got to hear this. That the Greek word for this life is Zoey. You may hear people refer to it as the God kind of life. Zoey is actually what the Bible translates as eternal life. The God kind of life. That life Zoey is the source of the energy that your spirit needs. You got fuel oil. You don't put fuel oil in cars that operate on gasoline. You got the electric cars now. You don't put gasoline except the dual ones. But I'm talking about those that operate by the electrical power. You don't put gasoline. Each has a particular type of energy source. And you got to respect the energy source. The spirit of the believer receives its power to operate or to function. As God has designed it to function from this energy source, this power source called e-turnal life or Zoey. With our biological life, your body cannot function. Without Zoey, your body, your spirit doesn't function. But if Zoey is in your spirit, then just like jet fuels make airplanes fly and gasoline makes automobiles run, eternal life makes your spirit function. And function just like Christ. Zoey, the source of energy for your spirit, causes your spirit to function just as God designed it, to love, to live, to believe, to laugh. Say this life that I have is the life of God in me. One more time, repeat it, say this life I have, is the life of God in me. And it is the presence of this life of God called e-turnal life in your spirit that gives you the capacity. It is the source of the love that you are called to walk in. It is the source of the faith you're called to exercise. It is the source of the peace you have an opportunity to experience. E-turnal life is not something you get after you die. E-turnal life is not in the future. Heaven is in the future. E-turnal life is in you now unless you're not a child of God. Are you listening? And this e-turnal life is so critical to everything God is doing and has done. If we don't understand what it means to have e-turnal life, we cannot understand new testament revelation. Your ability to comprehend and understand the revelation of the new covenant will be severely limited. If you don't grasp what it means to have e-turnal life, without that revelation your Christianity becomes no different from any other religion. It becomes laws that you try to obey based upon your own human effort and your own strength. And as far as I'm concerned, that's Islam, that's all of those religions. So it's important if you can understand the gospel. If you can understand the new covenant, if you're going to walk more and more fully in what God has provided through the new covenant, through the death of Jesus on the cross, you and I have to be grounded in the revelation of what we possess when we say we have e-turnal life. You hear me? So let's look at it. First, John 5, 11 to 13, please. The main e-turnal life is mentioned a lot in the new covenant, but especially in John's writings. So we're going to look at John's writing for the most part. Let's read this together. And this is the testament I like some translation states, and this is the record. I like that. This is the record. In other words, it all boils down to this. And this is the record. It all boils down to this. This is what the gospel is about. This is what the new covenant is built on. This is the record. It's short. It's certain. This is why we proclaim. And then what is the record? Why do we testify to that? God has given us e-turnal life. And this life is in His Son. Let's go ahead and reverse 12. We'll come back to verse 11, but look at verse 12. He who has the Son has life. I think, I think literally has the life. He who does not have the Son of God does not have life. He's not talking about bios. Because a lot of people who don't have the Son of God have bios. So he's not talking about that. He's talking about Zoe. He's talking about e-turnal life. That which gives you the capacity. I wish it's the feel for your spirit. That which enables your spirit to function and to do what God designed it for. That which enables your spirit to love is this life that he's talking about. That's the power source. Let's read that together. He who has the Son has life. He who does not have the Son of God. How many of you have the Son? Yeah, you have the Son if you have received Jesus as your Lord and Savior. And if you have the Son, you have what? And what is that life? E-turnal life Zoe, right? Thanks for this. These things, everybody. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may what? That you may what? That you may what? So it is critical that you know this. It means you cannot know it. I mean, you can't just like E-turnal life. You don't know it. That's not knowing it. Say, oh, I got to turn alive and that's it. You don't know what you have. You don't know what it can do. You don't know it. But it is critical. According to John, John, I'm writing all of this thing. You got the son. This is a record. You got everything else he has already said. And it says, I'm writing this for this purpose. That's how important it is. That's how important it is in John's mind. I believe it. You need to know this. Not be able to repeat what I just told you. But have revelation of this. Revelation of what? That you have. You want? You have. Not you will have. If you say, I will have E-turnal life. You don't know. And you don't have this knowledge. If you say, I will get E-turnal life. I will have E-turnal life. God will give me E-turnal life. You're calling God a liar. You're disagreeing with the truth. Because the truth isn't that you will receive E-turnal life in the future. The truth is, right now, you are half. The truth is, you right now have E-turnal life. Which means you right now have the capacity. That you need to have in order to love as Christless. In order to live as Christless. In order to laugh as Christ laughed. Each of us has the capacity. The capacity is found in E-turnal life. Notice that you may come to believe in the name of the Son of God. I'm writing these things so you can come to believe in the name of the Son of God so that you can have E-turnal life. And now you must know this. Next to you, do you know that you know that you know that you have E-turnal life? And do you know that you know what E-turnal life is? Said, do you really know what you have inside of you? Do you really know what is the power that is powering your spirit? Do you realize it is E-turnal life is so way? Not bios. That is energizing your spirit to function. One more time, this life. You see in me? Yes. I have in me. It is the life of the Son of God. Yeah, for emphasis. I'm putting the emphasis all there because that is what John did. In these three verses everywhere else, he keeps putting the emphasis to spotlight on E-turnal life. And you possessing it, you possessing it. I'm writing this whole book because I want you to know this. So we got to invest some time and energy, studying, meditating, reading, listening, hearing the sermons over and over again. Because we really want to know what we have. This is what the Holy Spirit wants us to see, to learn and not to forget. God has given you E-turnal life. John 3.16 says, for God so loved the world that he has, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should do what? God gave Jesus so that you can what? Jesus said in John 10.10, I have come that you may have life. So here's the bottom line. If anyone asks you why did God send Jesus? If anyone asks you why did Jesus come to earth? They asked us to be immediately evident to you. Don't come up with 10 different reasons. Don't make it complicated. It all can be reduced to this. The reason God sent His Son to earth and the reason Jesus came to earth is so that you and I can possess E-turnal life now. And forever. That's why it's called E-turnal, not temporary. Biological life is temporary. It's subject to decay. It's subject to sickness, fatigue and ultimately death. Not so with Zoe. Zoe is eternal and Zoe is not subject to death, to fatigue, decay, it's forever. That's why you are forever. Because for the rest of eternity, eternal life will be empowering you. And it cannot die. So since that wishes empowering your spirit cannot die, your spirit is going to live. Come on, raise your hands. I thank God for eternal life. So just quickly from what we've read, eternal life is a gift. It is not earned. Eternal life has been given, not will be given. Eternal life is a present possession, having this future. And eternal life is located in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the source of this eternal life. Who forever has the Son has life. Amen? Paul added his own voice to this in many places, but let me just quote one passage. Colossians 3 verse 3 to 4. For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. And when Christ who is our life appears, then we also will appear with Him. What does that say? Christ is our life. Eternal life is Christ in us. Eternal life is the light of Christ, the light of God in us. The source of the power, the energy that is supplying your spirit with the ability to function is a very life of Christ Himself. He's not just a giver of life, he is the life itself. You and Him are one spirit. He has joined Himself to you for this purpose, and He may be the source of the life that energizes your spirit to do whatever God has called it to do. And since we're focusing on love, He is the life joined to your spirit, supplying the love, energy you need to walk in love as He did. Come on, say right now in my spirit, eternal life, the life of Christ is energizing my spirit with love. One more time, eternal life inside of me is energizing my spirit with the very love of God. The passage as I say, the Holy Spirit has shed a broad the love of God in our hearts. He does it by means of eternal life. All right, so you got that. Eternal life is God's life in you, Christ's life in you, imparted to you, to your spirit, not to your body, through faith in Jesus. First John 49, please go there quickly. In this is the love of God, or in this the love of God was manifested towards us. Read it, that God has sent His only begotten Son, why? That we what might live through Him, or let me paraphrase it, that we might experience His life as ours. That's what it means. God manifested love, so it was the love of God that motivated God to send His Son so that we can have eternal life. Because God loves us so much, God wanted us to experience His life as our own. And it was so important to God that we be able to experience His life as our own, that He was willing to send His only begotten Son. So Christianity, guys, is not just doctrine. Christianity is participating in the very life of God inside your spirit. I'm a Christian because the life of God eternal life is dwelling in my spirit, and I am right now being energized and empowered in my spirit to be all that God has called me to be. To do all that God has called me to do, and to love you as Christ loves the church. Amen? This source of this love is not my strength. I don't have that in myself. Bios, biological life cannot be the source of that kind of love. Biological love just enables our selfishness that is present in our soul and in our body. But we need a love that is strong enough to overcome it. Or the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. The law of sin and death operates with biological life. The law of the spirit of life is a higher life that is able to overcome the law of sin and death operating in my body just like the law of aerodynamics overcomes the law of gravity making an airplane fly even though gravity is trying to pull it down. And even though the flesh is pulling you to selfishness, even though biological life is pulling you to just think about yourself, protect yourself, and all of that. Are you hear me? There is a higher law at work. It is a higher life you have available to you in your spirit that is able to transcend and overcome the law of sin and death that is at work in your flesh causing you to walk in love even while your flesh is trying to pull you down. Say hallelujah! I don't know if the choir can sing this life that I have is the life of God in me. You okay? Sing us one thing yesterday. You got it? I think the people need to hear it. Help me preach a little bit, somebody. I'm not finished yet though. I'm not done. But I think you need to sing a little bit. Come on, go ahead. This life that I have is the life of God in me. God sent his son, motivated by his great love, so that we might experience his life as our own. Let me derive a number of important points from that statement. God's purpose is not to empower you to lead your own life. I know, oh God, help me. And you want God to empower you as naturally, but he was empowered. You give you some strength to lead your own life for him. But God's purpose here me is to empower you to experience his own life as your own. God does not improve your human nature. You don't come to God and He takes you so I will make you better. He puts it to death, takes it completely out of the way. He throws it behind his back because he has no need for it. He does not try to improve you, so I know you try to improve yourself. Be your best you. No, no, what God does is He replaces your life with His own. And that is what eternal life is. It is God replacing your life with His own so that His life is what is empowering your spirit. I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ lives in me. My old life is not redeemed and made better. God doesn't do what it called fixer upper. God doesn't take the house and let me change it and make it look good. No, he says demolish it. We're starting from scratch. And this time I'm going to supply all of the material. I'm making you brand new within a man being Christ. He is a new creation. All things are passed away and behold, all things have become new. God, listen to me and I know I've done this. We say come and give your life to Christ. The truth is God doesn't want your life. What are you giving your life to Him for? He's already condemned it. Salvation is now you giving your life to Christ so He can improve it. God doesn't want you to give Him your life. God wants you to take His life. Oh, Salah, bless you. God wants you to take His life. The invitation should be come and take the life of Jesus because your own is condemned. Your own is good for nothing. Your own is trash. Your own needs to be thrown away that own nature. There's nothing good in it. Come and take the life of God for yourself. Come and take the life of Christ and make the life of Christ your own. That's what eternal life is. You take the life of Christ and by faith, you make that life your own so that you begin to live from that life. The life that God has called you to live. Turn to your neighbor and say apart from Jesus' life inside of you, you can do nothing. You cannot love your neighbor as yourself apart from the life and the love of Christ in you. And if you're trying to do it in your strength, you will fail and be frustrated and be condemned. None of which God wants for you. So how many of you? How many of you are going to take His life? Come and raise your hand. I'm going to take His life. Come on. I take His life. His life is my life. His life is the source of my power. Oh, so quickly, oh my goodness. I've answered the capacity problem. Question. I've demonstrated that the capacity to love comes from the eternal life that God has given you. And the capacity to believe is in that life too. The capacity to obey is there. The capacity to do everything God has called you to do is found in the life of God called eternal life that is literally fueling energizing your spirits right now. My spirit is being energized with love. And guess what? Your spirit is too. Now, the question then, well, how do I get this love that is energizing my spirit, supplying strength and all of this to manifest more consistently to overcome the selfishness, the self-sensiveness that is present, not in my spirit, but in my soul and in my body. You want us to look at that? But I only got 44 more seconds. Should I ask Pastor Kessmey to spare me and give me a little bit? Or should we come back next week? Should you come back next week, right? Yeah, we'll come back next week. Pastor Kessmey, now what must I do? Amen. But let me just, I don't really know if we have time to, if I were to try to do the other one, we could go another 30 minutes. So maybe we'll just wait. But I think this is enough for you to start meditating on. Here is what you need to do this week. Start to meditate on what this eternal life is and what this eternal life can do. Let's, let's escort John 1010. All of us know John 1010, right? Well, let's repeat it. The fifth comes to steal. That is Satan's agenda to steal, to kill and to destroy. And then the next word is what? But stop, but, but, but. In other words, I've come to do something completely different. This is what he has come to do. But, what he has come to do, I have come to overcome. I have come to destroy. I have come to spoil. But I have come that you may want to have life, that's eternal life. And that much more. So I've come that you may have eternal life in abundance. If you think through that a little bit more, you realize that eternal life in abundance is God's answer or rebuke to the devil. In other words, eternal life is God's response to things that come to steal. Things that come to kill. Things that come to destroy. Everything the enemy has designed in order to bring you harm. God says here's a solution eternal life. Eternal life is God's answer to the devil's attack on your life. It is God's answer to the devil's attack on your health. The devil's attack on your mind. The devil's attack on your spirit. The devil's attack on your money. The devil's attack on your family. Whatever the devil is doing to steal killing the shore, God says eternal life is my answer to it. Because when the devil meets eternal life, come next week. In the name of Jesus, everybody stands to your feet. Hallelujah. Oh, my goodness. Next week we're going to continue. And that means I got a whole week to meditate some more. Amen. I got a whole week to learn some more. So next week we'll be able to do even more. But for now, I want everybody to embrace this revelation. And remember, these things I have written said John, so you may know. Just being able to repeat what I said just now doesn't mean you know. You need to take this and meditate on it and ask the Holy Spirit to expand it. Ask the Holy Spirit to give you illustrations that make sense to you. But at the end of the day, you need to be grounded in this revelation. And know that because eternal life is inside of you, the capacity to love is already working in you. Let me give this to you. The key to walking more and more in this love that is available is revelation of it and reliance on it. This is what Jesus said. Jesus said, ask the father. Oh, I'm in there. I'm asked the father has loved me. So have our love. Just meditate on that. Do you know how much the father love Jesus? Do you know? You don't know. I don't know. We got an idea. But we need to meditate more on this. So that we know how much the father love Jesus and therefore how much Jesus loves us. Because this is what Jesus said. The father loves me no more than I love you. And just like the father would withhold no good thing from me, I will never withhold anything good from you. So not to take in that revelation as to see how much Jesus loves you. Then the next thing he says, abide in my love. In other words, abide in this revelation of how much I love you. Don't move from there. Stay there. Don't move one inch. The revelation that I love you as much as the father loves me. You are to go deeper, receive more, understand it more and then stop on the refuse. abide. Stay there. Remain there. Let nothing move you away from it. Be stubbornly stubborn. That's correct. It's standing on this revelation of how much God loves you. Hear me? Because when you know how much God loves you and you can get to the point where you really believe. Jesus loves you as much as God loves him. You become the most secure person. Hear me? When you are secure in God's, in knowing you are loved, it's so easy to love others. Most of the reasons we struggle with loving people is because we're struggling with believing we're loved. We are still trying to be loved and so we find ourselves depending upon people to make us feel love and then we are defending ourselves anytime. But when you are so secure and you know that you know you have a revelation of the degree to which God loves you, you become so secure, you don't have to defend yourself, you don't have to protect yourself. So when people act the fool, you just, you don't have to fight back. But if I fight myself, having to defend myself and protect myself and always get upset because you didn't treat me right, that's an indication of a love insufficiency or a deficit in my understanding of how much I am loved by Christ. I shut up 10 minutes ago. Raise your head. We'll develop that more. Father, in the name of Jesus, you love us with the everlasting love. Jesus loves us as much as you love him. We have the capacity to love because we have your life and the nature of your life is love. So thank you that the natural expression of the eternal life that we have is love. The capacity is there. We pray now for revelation and to help us rely. So we might experience that life in that love more and more fully in us in Jesus name. Before we go, is there someone here who says, Bishop, I need to take the life of Christ. It's not so much. I want to receive Christ's life as my own right now. I want this eternal life you talked about to dwell on the inside of me. And I know that it's in Jesus and the only way I can receive it is through Jesus. Every head by please. If you don't have the certainty that Christ is alive in you, that you have received His life and therefore you are saved. Please don't leave here until you receive this most precious gift. You cannot afford to go one other day without eternal life inside of you. The eternal life will change you. Don't try to change yourself. The eternal life will change you but receive it now. If that's you, right where you are, just a bishop. I want you to pray with me because I want to receive this. I want to take whole of this in Jesus name. Okay, if you know you have that eternal life, raise your hands to heaven. Now your job today and the rest of your life is to receive more and more revelation concerning this eternal life and to learn to rely on it constantly. Abide in that revelation. Don't let anything move you from it in Jesus name. We will develop this more next week. God bless you, you may have your sins.

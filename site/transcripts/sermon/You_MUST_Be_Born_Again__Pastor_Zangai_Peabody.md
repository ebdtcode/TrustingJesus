Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. What a thank God for Bishop and Lady Chris for the opportunity to minister in this house. Amen. Well, I don't know about you. You know, when we're growing up in Christendom, I experienced something. I do not know whether you experienced it for those who this phrase to be born again. I remember how I can say we were persecuted for associating ourselves with people who termed themselves that they were born again. I mean, and most of the people who did that were trash people. They saw us as young people now, so they will look at you and say, so you are other people who say you are born again. They saw you as being frustrated. They said you had no social life. You were a loser. You're going nowhere. And it was as if Christianity is here in the church. And then we were a bunch of fanatics, people who, you know, you are either a Methodist or Episcopalian or a Catholic. Who are these people who are calling themselves born again? So if those people who torment at me went back then, if you are watching today, I can't today to tell you who is born again. I somebody on your side, are you born again? So go with me to John, chapter three. John verse one to six. All right. First of all, I didn't develop the term born again. The person who spoke this term was Jesus. You remember Jesus? This is the person. First of all, all of us said we were shopping and we said he is the son of God. So if he developed the turn or he spoke about it, then all of us must stick it seriously. It was Nicodemus who came, a Pharisee who came, a religious ruler of the day who came to Jesus, seeking to comprehend something that he has seen about Jesus and his ministry. He wanted to wrap his puny brain around what Jesus was doing. And therefore, he came and the scripture says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and he said, he will respect Jesus now. All right, rabbi, we know that you are a teacher and you come from God. For no one can do the signs that you do unless God is with Him. Are you there? And Jesus answered and said to him most surely I say to you, unless Jesus never answered his question. You see, unless one is born again, he cannot see. It's like somebody trying to come to the USA. And the person telling you, oh, my uncle invited me. I received a letter. I got my passport. I got my ticket. And he asked them, do you have a valid American visa? And the person is laughing at you. And you tell the person, you cannot enter the USA without a valid visa. And the person actually making you into a school. Like you don't know what you are talking about. I listen to me. It is Jesus who said, look, the thing you're trying to comprehend without you being born again. You can't understand it. In Liberals, they're Kuku, Jumuku. Can you say it with me? Why? Kuku, Jumuku. If you are not inside, you can't know. All right, except you are born again, you can't comprehend this. Now, where he was coming from, it seemed as if in their community they have been speaking about Jesus. So, go with me to Mark 11, 27 to 28. Mark 11. I want to show you that then they came again to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, see them, the scribes, and the elders that came to him. Verse 28. And it's said to him, by what authority are you doing these things? Who gives you this authority that if you read the verses above, some of the things that Jesus had done, he had gone into the temple. He's not a priest, he's not a high priest. But he wept the people out of the temple. He overturned the table. So, these guys are looking, we've been here. Some of our people selling here, everything will have not changed anything. And you're just coming and you're just acting some kind. So, who gives you the authority to do what you're doing? The miracles that you are performing, how are you doing this? And this is all what is in Nicodemus' mind when he comes at night to visit with Jesus. The school went to Matthew selling verse 29. Okay. For he taught them as one having authority and he did not teach them as the scribes. So, the mannerism of Jesus when he did his ministry was different from them. And therefore, our old man, J. Nick, has come at night to experience, to find out what this man was all about. And it's at this particular time that Jesus tells him, except you'll be born again. You cannot even in a million chance. You cannot partake off. You cannot experience. You cannot comprehend. You cannot wrap your brain around the things that pertains to the kingdom of God. We're talking about spiritual things here. Let me go back to John 3. You are a teacher of Israel. And you do not understand these earthly terms I'm using because right after that, Nicodemus said, you mean he should have been slapped when he answered like that. Do you mean I must ask a man? You know, those are how spiritually dense he was. And I can't imagine because this is somebody who has studied a lot. I'm trying to understand you are teaching from God. I've seen things happen. And I've come to you. And you are saying these things about being born again. Should I ask a man, look, work with me here, Rabbi. Should I now, then Jesus, I like what he says to him, you know, that which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again. I think it's verse, verse 10. Can you go to verse 10? Jesus answered a said to him, are you a teacher of Israel? And you do not know these things. Most assuredly, verse 11, we speak what we know. We testify of things that we have seen. I'm not just speaking air, say. Okay. Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak of these things. And verse 12, if I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, now will you believe if I tell you heavenly things I'm using earthly terms to explain to you heavenly things. And if you cannot, look, there are spiritual things and there are earthly things. And Nicodemus, he was just born. When I check the scriptures, it's not only Nicodemus who had this problem. Even Jesus disciples had issues with him. Go with me to Matthew 16, verse 21 to 23. Nicodemus inability to grasp spiritual things was not limited to him alone. From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. He must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the scribes. He must be killed and be raised on the third. The Jesus is telling his disciples. This one, yeah, he's not covering it like he was doing it for Nicodemus. He's telling them direct spiritual truth. See the response, verse 22. Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke you. Look, no, we're thinking about kingdom thing. Are you coming to die? No, you can't die. Rebuke him, saying, far be it from you Lord. This shall not happen to you, verse 23. But he turned and said to Peter, get deep behind me, Satan. You are an offense to me at this moment for you are not mindful of things of God. Listen, see it there. You are not mindful of things of God but things of man. That's a principle right there. Okay. That's what he said. Spiritual things are spiritual things. Earthly things are earthly things. Peter right now you are speaking like a natural man. All right. And that's the whole thing that Nicodemus, that was Nicodemus' problem and Bishop said, man's problem is not that he needs more teaching. Man needs life because man is dead spiritually. You, you, you understanding? Let's see what Paul says. First Corinthians chapter 2, it's time of verse 14. I like what Paul says about this. He says, the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of God. Let it rest. It's possible for you to be in church for the years. But you are not born again. Okay. You're doing things your own way, you know. Hallelujah. I was an alcoholic. When the priest ring the bell, who, and I used to do the incense, he come on the side, he tell everybody, you know, and then you take the incense, having a form of Godliness but denying the power. The, they're off. You inside, you don't know, not just the blind, leaving the blind. The natural man cannot receive the things of the spirit of God for the afolishness to him. No, I can't know them because they are spiritually discern. All right. So we come back to the story with Nicodemus. Jesus just gave him an indictment. You are dead. And it's a waste of time for me to convey to you spiritual things at this particular point until you come alive with a different kind of life. I can't talk to you. Hallelujah. Romans 5, Romans 5, 12. I loved my Apostle Paul. Romans 5, verse 12. Therefore just ask through one man, sin entered the world. Therefore death through sin thus death spread to all man because of sin. I remember it back in the day when the church. The media team, like how we're doing right now, the recording, the message and right after the end of the message, the media team will take the master copy DVD and CD and run next door. They had a duplicating machine. Put it in there to start the duplicating. So by the time services over people can have the recording. If the master copy was done well, no problem. And they didn't have time to come and listen to see or watch and see whether the duplicator did a good job or the master copy was done well. So they just duplicate it. The problem was if there was a problem in the recording of the master copy, then everybody started to report. There's nothing else. The sound was not there and start to give. And all of the recordings come out bad. All right. So Adam was our master copy. Adam was our prototype. And through Adam, all of us was in Adam. When Adam messed up. Everything that came out of Adam was messed up. So I didn't have I don't have to sin for you to call me a sinner. I am born a sinner. That is that was my character. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner.

I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I can't do all things through Christ who gives me the strength. I choose to be in Jesus. I refuse to be in Adam. If you want to be in what? What Adam? Then are your business? Is this a simple? It's simple as that. Glory. Hallelujah. I have a new life. Ask me. I tell him, be patient. I'm a brand of things. Hallelujah. So, as I said, there are people who could be in church like Nicodemus, having become a ruler and a teacher of Israel, but you're not born again. You don't have this new life and you can be an usher in the choir, just going with the flow. But you lack the essence for which the church came about. Today, don't leave real. We're not making up the decision. I want to be born again. I desire a new life. Then this is not the only place that word is used. Go with me to 1st Peter, 1 verse 23, 1st Peter, 1 verse 23. 1st Peter, 1 verse 23. 1st Peter, 1 verse 23. I sound like the airport. Haven't been born again. You see that? Now, listen, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus and using natural means to convey spiritual truth. And the mean way I know that someone can have life in this world is through birth. So he says, you must be born a new again. The same way a man will put sperm within a woman for the woman to become pregnant so she can give birth to a child. He plays seed in the woman. So the word says, haven't been born again. Not of the endemic seed or the corrupted seed of sin. Born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible through the word of God, which lives and abides forever. It is the word of God. That's why he said, you must be born again. And do not mind what that I said to be born again. Be born of him after water. And that speaks of the word of God. Listen, when you listen to the word of God, the word of God goes into the womb of your spirit by way of your ear or goodness. You sit in there and God is operating on you through his Word, putting in your life, his kind of life, not your kind of life that your mother gave you. Oh, you know, some people you got you got you got some habits that you want to break. You can break it. Just die. That's a new word you have created. Just by by yourself. How you can buy yourself, you know, some people won't commit suicide because of whatever you can buy yourself without buying really. That's also when Paul says I am crucified with Christ. Really? When Jesus died, I died. That's what Paul meant. I am crucified. I was crucified with Christ on the cross of Calvary. Nevertheless, I live, but it's no longer I that lives. And it's Christ who lives in and through me. Tell somebody you must be born again with with other new birth. You cannot experience the kingdom of God. Now, the word kingdom there is not heaven. So just for you to know, this is just a side piece. I'm not speaking about heaven. He's not speaking because the things that this saw Jesus doing on earth, it was not, you know, that's what Jesus tells. Say what you pray pray, that kingdom, your rule come on earth as it is in heaven. So kingdom, look, look, look, look 17. Am I doing well with my time? Look 17, verse 20 to 21. My people, look 17. Yes, now when they ask about the Pharisees, when will the kingdom of God come? He said to them, the kingdom of God does not come by you observing rules and regulations, but you're doing things first one, first one, no, will they say, see it there. See it here. For indeed, the kingdom of God is where? It's inside. Say it's inside. And we are where? If you are not inside, you will not know. The kingdom of God is within you. Romans 14, verse 17. Paul says it this way. Romans 14, verse 17. You got it there. Righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost. Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, that's the kingdom of God. Righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost. Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, that's won't you be a part of the kingdom? Don't you be a part? Won't you be a part? Come on, come on everybody, there's joy in this kingdom child, there's peace. Come on everybody. So why would you want to stay in the nightclub? You want to continue being in that old way, old style of life? Paul says the kingdom of God. So when Jesus said except you be born again, you cannot experience, you cannot enter righteousness, you have nothing to understand about the righteousness of God that is in Christ Jesus. Your own righteousness is like filthy rice, but this righteousness is like giving to us from God. He who knew no sin, became sin that you and I can become the righteousness of who God. So I can fall a drop up. I'm in Jesus, I'm righteous. It is not my sinning that gives me my standing in righteousness. No, it's because of who he is and what he did that makes me righteous. Are you with me? Who? The Bible is unbelievable. Look, look, look, look. I think it's Proverbs 28 verse 1. The Bible says the righteous is as bold. So that's what they were saying. That's what Nicodemus and his crew were saying when Jesus had the audacity to whip people and he was not a priest. This is exuding righteousness, righteousness in the nation. And give you the authority to do the sins. Then on the Sabbath day he healing people. And then when he's teaching, he's teaching in that like, I just wrote reading, reading from another book, they call it the God of Book, the Torah or the Eucharist. Some rare book in a piece of what you're sorry, that's where I come from. The common prayer book, yeah. And it just every Sunday you come, that's the same common prayer. You don't have your own prayer. You can't generate. You say you in love with me, but every time you come to me, it is the same thing. The same thing down, oh great Father. Look, lift me alone. Oh, like a liar. Oh my, look, look, look. He stayed behind for Lazarus to die. And that cow said, you show me where you lay him. I said, but now he stinks, Lord. Just take me there. Move the stew. I believe people are beating people sweating. Well, what is he about to do it here? Someone said, if he had just said, come, every, every dead body. So you are very careful. Then there will be people here. You are dead. There are dead situations in your life. Dead relationships, dead businesses, those are Lazarus. I feel they're not in the house. I come from the dead in the name of Jesus. We go to the spirit of God. We go to the takes of God, that husband, that relationship, that person in your life. You'll be praying for that person to come alive in Jesus. We declare life in the name of Jesus. The eyes of the understanding will be enlightened. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. The righteous is what? Proverbs 15. I believe it's 29. The Lord is far from the wicked. But he is the prayers of the righteous. Hallelujah. The Lord hears the prayers of the righteous. In front of Lazarus grave. This is when he got there. He says, Lord, Father, I thank you. You hear me, how? Why should I be bold? If my God can answer me, every time I call to him in prayer, you think I will be playing young girl? That's what I said when I came to this country and saw American kids. Even when they go abroad and they're acting foolish, they got the backing of the government. They're doing something. Government send helicopter and take them out. Even when government comes to police, these guys will arrest you. They're on the highway. Then they put their vehicle butt in the traffic. You'll stop. You can't do nothing. They are backed by that bash, that uniform, that car, and they got the gun. You can't do nothing. They are backed by the government. It's not a war like being police. But as a hobby, I was not saved then. I did Michelin Street between Michelin Education and Finance Minister. That's on one way street. I don't know. I didn't grow up in like Banovia. I came to the other side with my mother's car and the police came. Put his hand. Oh man, you don't want to see me while not born again. Put the traffic. You speak to the police like that. Yeah, move man. Hey, miss, can't you see the sign and you can't see the sign? Do you know that's one way I said I do not know. Come, come, come, come, come. He came. I told you, that was before I became the righteous is as well. The prayer of the righteous, they are answered by God. Oh, and then they said the prayer. All right, the right prayer. Let me, let me read this. The effecture, fervent prayer of the righteous, the effective. He's not praying out of his head. He's such the scriptures and this is what God wants to do. And he prays God. He prays God's work. I was a young man when Bishop said this. If God spoke to you and told you there is a hold in the wall. He says, go all the way to the end of the room. Run with all of your might. You don't see the whole jump with all of it when you get there. The whole will become a whole. You are not doing it on your own accord. It's just like when he spoke to Moses and told him stretch forth. It looks so silly. It looks so unnatural. Ratsy will go through the ratsy and you imagine him, quarry with God and God telling him, shut up man. And just do what I'm telling you to do. Moses does it and the ratsy. Those are the type of things that the people around saw Jesus doing. And this man had to come by night to inquire who, who gives it to this. That's how we ought to live in this time, these end times. People should see signs and oneness. We know that you are on furlough. We know that it took away your, your whatever you, your employment. How are you making it? I believe in God. I have it like Jesus said. There another source of food that you do not know of. I have another means of supplying man without you knowing what to do that. You must be born again. Hallelujah. The steps of the righteous, the order of God. God, God indirect you. God will show you. You get to go to God in prayer. My wife was supposed to come. She was supposed to come to the find a hill yesterday. She didn't come. So we'll come into there. She said, I want to tell you something. You know, so I was listening to this man of God and the man of God said, we should think this way. She said, she was trying to come up with something, how to teach her children at her school. She's an elementary school teacher because in the sounds of the alphabet, how to let us can make it. So for how to introduce it. She said, so when I heard I met talking, I said, the reason why I didn't do anything in the house, I couldn't get, is I wash all the different, different people doing theirs, but there was just something different. She said, all of a sudden, the spirit of God gave me an idea. When she said the idea, I said, look, if we develop the team, we can come again, we've come a million years. So I mean, she's telling me this story. I'm not a child, but all of a sudden, this child like happiness just came up. I said, look, I already won't come to your class. I said, he leads you. He shows you things to this. This is the life we have our personal GPS. We are led, we are spirit led. Those who are sons of God, they are led by the spirit. So if you are here, you're not, you're not born again. It's about time that you left that old duplicate machine. If you struggling with habits that came from the Adamic line, it can be killed in Jesus through your exercising of your faith. Hallelujah. Born, born, born again. Thank God I'm born again. Born, born, born again. Born again. Born again. Born, born. Thank God. Born again. Thank God I'm born again. For those of you that left us to score, I tell you, born of the what I am, spirit and the blood. I thank God. I did not listen to you. I would have been by now Aslan who have killed me. By now poverty will have put me on the side. But where I am, you all cannot even figure out how someone who did not, did not graduate, how come he is where he is? It is because of this new life. Hallelujah. So if you are sitting, and you came this morning, and you have never given your life to Jesus before, said may not, the time is now. It's about time that you'll be born. Thank you.

**[02:03 - 02:08]** And it was as if Christianity is here in the church.

**[02:08 - 02:21]** And then we were a bunch of fanatics, people who, you know, you are either a Methodist or Episcopalian or a Catholic.

**[02:21 - 02:27]** Who are these people who are calling themselves born again?

**[02:27 - 02:43]** So if those people who torment at me went back then, if you are watching today, I can't today to tell you who is born again.

**[02:43 - 02:47]** I somebody on your side, are you born again?

**[02:47 - 02:51]** So go with me to John, chapter three.

**[02:51 - 02:54]** John verse one to six.

**[02:54 - 03:02]** All right. First of all, I didn't develop the term born again.

**[03:02 - 03:07]** The person who spoke this term was Jesus.

**[03:07 - 03:10]** You remember Jesus? This is the person.

**[03:10 - 03:13]** First of all, all of us said we were shopping and we said he is the son of God.

**[03:13 - 03:20]** So if he developed the turn or he spoke about it, then all of us must stick it seriously.

**[03:20 - 03:41]** It was Nicodemus who came, a Pharisee who came, a religious ruler of the day who came to Jesus, seeking to comprehend something that he has seen about Jesus and his ministry.

**[03:41 - 03:48]** He wanted to wrap his puny brain around what Jesus was doing.

**[03:48 - 03:59]** And therefore, he came and the scripture says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

**[03:59 - 04:09]** This man came to Jesus by night and he said, he will respect Jesus now.

**[04:09 - 04:19]** All right, rabbi, we know that you are a teacher and you come from God.

**[04:19 - 04:29]** For no one can do the signs that you do unless God is with Him.

**[04:29 - 04:41]** Are you there? And Jesus answered and said to him most surely I say to you, unless Jesus never answered his question.

**[04:41 - 04:50]** You see, unless one is born again, he cannot see.

**[04:50 - 04:54]** It's like somebody trying to come to the USA.

**[04:54 - 05:03]** And the person telling you, oh, my uncle invited me. I received a letter. I got my passport. I got my ticket.

**[05:03 - 05:13]** And he asked them, do you have a valid American visa? And the person is laughing at you.

**[05:13 - 05:24]** And you tell the person, you cannot enter the USA without a valid visa.

**[05:24 - 05:33]** And the person actually making you into a school. Like you don't know what you are talking about.

**[05:33 - 05:48]** I listen to me. It is Jesus who said, look, the thing you're trying to comprehend without you being born again.

**[05:48 - 05:57]** You can't understand it. In Liberals, they're Kuku, Jumuku. Can you say it with me? Why? Kuku, Jumuku.

**[05:57 - 06:12]** If you are not inside, you can't know. All right, except you are born again, you can't comprehend this.

**[06:12 - 06:22]** Now, where he was coming from, it seemed as if in their community they have been speaking about Jesus.

**[06:22 - 06:33]** So, go with me to Mark 11, 27 to 28. Mark 11. I want to show you that then they came again to Jerusalem.

**[06:33 - 06:43]** As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, see them, the scribes, and the elders that came to him.

**[06:43 - 06:53]** Verse 28. And it's said to him, by what authority are you doing these things?

**[06:53 - 07:04]** Who gives you this authority that if you read the verses above, some of the things that Jesus had done, he had gone into the temple.

**[07:04 - 07:13]** He's not a priest, he's not a high priest. But he wept the people out of the temple. He overturned the table.

**[07:13 - 07:19]** So, these guys are looking, we've been here. Some of our people selling here, everything will have not changed anything.

**[07:19 - 07:28]** And you're just coming and you're just acting some kind. So, who gives you the authority to do what you're doing?

**[07:28 - 07:41]** The miracles that you are performing, how are you doing this? And this is all what is in Nicodemus' mind when he comes at night to visit with Jesus.

**[07:41 - 07:46]** The school went to Matthew selling verse 29. Okay.

**[07:46 - 07:56]** For he taught them as one having authority and he did not teach them as the scribes.

**[07:56 - 08:03]** So, the mannerism of Jesus when he did his ministry was different from them.

**[08:03 - 08:17]** And therefore, our old man, J. Nick, has come at night to experience, to find out what this man was all about.

**[08:17 - 08:23]** And it's at this particular time that Jesus tells him, except you'll be born again.

**[08:23 - 08:33]** You cannot even in a million chance. You cannot partake off. You cannot experience. You cannot comprehend.

**[08:33 - 08:44]** You cannot wrap your brain around the things that pertains to the kingdom of God. We're talking about spiritual things here.

**[08:44 - 08:58]** Let me go back to John 3. You are a teacher of Israel.

**[08:58 - 09:09]** And you do not understand these earthly terms I'm using because right after that, Nicodemus said,

**[09:09 - 09:20]** you mean he should have been slapped when he answered like that. Do you mean I must ask a man?

**[09:20 - 09:31]** You know, those are how spiritually dense he was. And I can't imagine because this is somebody who has studied a lot.

**[09:31 - 09:38]** I'm trying to understand you are teaching from God. I've seen things happen. And I've come to you.

**[09:38 - 09:51]** And you are saying these things about being born again. Should I ask a man, look, work with me here, Rabbi.

**[09:51 - 10:10]** Should I now, then Jesus, I like what he says to him, you know, that which is born of the flesh is flesh.

**[10:10 - 10:21]** That which is born of the spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.

**[10:21 - 10:30]** I think it's verse, verse 10. Can you go to verse 10? Jesus answered a said to him,

**[10:30 - 10:37]** are you a teacher of Israel? And you do not know these things. Most assuredly, verse 11,

**[10:37 - 10:49]** we speak what we know. We testify of things that we have seen.

**[10:49 - 10:58]** I'm not just speaking air, say. Okay.

**[10:58 - 11:05]** Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak of these things. And verse 12, if I have told you earthly things and you do not believe,

**[11:05 - 11:19]** now will you believe if I tell you heavenly things I'm using earthly terms to explain to you heavenly things.

**[11:19 - 11:27]** And if you cannot, look, there are spiritual things and there are earthly things.

**[11:27 - 11:43]** And Nicodemus, he was just born. When I check the scriptures, it's not only Nicodemus who had this problem.

**[11:43 - 11:58]** Even Jesus disciples had issues with him. Go with me to Matthew 16, verse 21 to 23.

**[11:58 - 12:18]** Nicodemus inability to grasp spiritual things was not limited to him alone. From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem.

**[12:18 - 12:28]** He must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the scribes. He must be killed and be raised on the third.

**[12:28 - 12:37]** The Jesus is telling his disciples. This one, yeah, he's not covering it like he was doing it for Nicodemus.

**[12:37 - 12:51]** He's telling them direct spiritual truth. See the response, verse 22. Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke you.

**[12:51 - 12:55]** Look, no, we're thinking about kingdom thing. Are you coming to die? No, you can't die.

**[12:55 - 13:05]** Rebuke him, saying, far be it from you Lord. This shall not happen to you, verse 23.

**[13:05 - 13:18]** But he turned and said to Peter, get deep behind me, Satan. You are an offense to me at this moment for you are not mindful of things of God.

**[13:18 - 13:33]** Listen, see it there. You are not mindful of things of God but things of man. That's a principle right there. Okay. That's what he said.

**[13:33 - 13:44]** Spiritual things are spiritual things. Earthly things are earthly things. Peter right now you are speaking like a natural man.

**[13:44 - 13:54]** All right. And that's the whole thing that Nicodemus, that was Nicodemus' problem and Bishop said, man's problem is not that he needs more teaching.

**[13:54 - 14:06]** Man needs life because man is dead spiritually. You, you, you understanding? Let's see what Paul says.

**[14:06 - 14:29]** First Corinthians chapter 2, it's time of verse 14. I like what Paul says about this. He says, the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of God. Let it rest.

**[14:29 - 14:47]** It's possible for you to be in church for the years. But you are not born again. Okay. You're doing things your own way, you know. Hallelujah.

**[14:54 - 15:32]** I was an alcoholic. When the priest ring the bell, who, and I used to do the incense, he come on the side, he tell everybody, you know, and then you take the incense, having a form of Godliness but denying the power.

**[15:32 - 15:52]** The, they're off. You inside, you don't know, not just the blind, leaving the blind. The natural man cannot receive the things of the spirit of God for the afolishness to him.

**[15:53 - 16:10]** No, I can't know them because they are spiritually discern. All right. So we come back to the story with Nicodemus. Jesus just gave him an indictment. You are dead.

**[16:10 - 16:28]** And it's a waste of time for me to convey to you spiritual things at this particular point until you come alive with a different kind of life. I can't talk to you. Hallelujah.

**[16:28 - 16:58]** Romans 5, Romans 5, 12. I loved my Apostle Paul. Romans 5, verse 12. Therefore just ask through one man, sin entered the world. Therefore death through sin thus death spread to all man because of sin. I remember it back in the day when the church.

**[16:58 - 17:27]** The media team, like how we're doing right now, the recording, the message and right after the end of the message, the media team will take the master copy DVD and CD and run next door. They had a duplicating machine. Put it in there to start the duplicating. So by the time services over people can have the recording.

**[17:27 - 17:43]** If the master copy was done well, no problem. And they didn't have time to come and listen to see or watch and see whether the duplicator did a good job or the master copy was done well. So they just duplicate it.

**[17:43 - 18:13]** The problem was if there was a problem in the recording of the master copy, then everybody started to report. There's nothing else. The sound was not there and start to give. And all of the recordings come out bad. All right. So Adam was our master copy. Adam was our prototype.

**[18:13 - 18:38]** And through Adam, all of us was in Adam. When Adam messed up. Everything that came out of Adam was messed up. So I didn't have I don't have to sin for you to call me a sinner. I am born a sinner. That is that was my character.

**[18:38 - 19:09]** I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner.

**[24:58 - 25:37]** I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner.

I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner.

**[25:37 - 26:10]** I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner. I'm born a sinner.

**[26:10 - 26:18]** I can't do all things through Christ who gives me the strength. I choose to be in Jesus.

**[26:18 - 26:22]** I refuse to be in Adam. If you want to be in what? What Adam?

**[26:22 - 26:44]** Then are your business? Is this a simple? It's simple as that. Glory. Hallelujah.

**[26:44 - 27:55]** I have a new life. Ask me. I tell him, be patient. I'm a brand of things. Hallelujah.

**[27:55 - 28:10]** So, as I said, there are people who could be in church like Nicodemus, having become a ruler

**[28:10 - 28:24]** and a teacher of Israel, but you're not born again. You don't have this new life and

**[28:24 - 28:38]** you can be an usher in the choir, just going with the flow. But you lack the essence for

**[28:38 - 28:47]** which the church came about. Today, don't leave real. We're not making up the decision.

**[28:47 - 28:55]** I want to be born again. I desire a new life. Then this is not the only place that word

**[28:55 - 29:09]** is used. Go with me to 1st Peter, 1 verse 23, 1st Peter, 1 verse 23. 1st Peter, 1 verse 23.

**[29:09 - 29:25]** 1st Peter, 1 verse 23. I sound like the airport. Haven't been born again. You see that?

**[29:26 - 29:38]** Now, listen, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus and using natural means to convey spiritual truth.

**[29:40 - 29:50]** And the mean way I know that someone can have life in this world is through birth. So he says,

**[29:50 - 30:06]** you must be born a new again. The same way a man will put sperm within a woman for the woman to

**[30:06 - 30:18]** become pregnant so she can give birth to a child. He plays seed in the woman. So the word says,

**[30:18 - 30:30]** haven't been born again. Not of the endemic seed or the corrupted seed of sin. Born again,

**[30:30 - 30:41]** not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible through the word of God, which lives and abides forever.

**[30:41 - 30:47]** It is the word of God. That's why he said, you must be born again. And do not mind what

**[30:47 - 30:53]** that I said to be born again. Be born of him after water. And that speaks of the word of God.

**[30:56 - 31:07]** Listen, when you listen to the word of God, the word of God goes into the womb of your spirit

**[31:07 - 31:22]** by way of your ear or goodness. You sit in there and God is operating on you through his

**[31:22 - 31:29]** Word, putting in your life, his kind of life, not your kind of life that your mother gave you.

**[31:31 - 31:36]** Oh, you know, some people you got you got you got some habits that you want to break. You can

**[31:36 - 31:46]** break it. Just die. That's a new word you have created. Just by by yourself. How you can buy

**[31:46 - 31:53]** yourself, you know, some people won't commit suicide because of whatever you can buy yourself without

**[31:53 - 32:12]** buying really. That's also when Paul says I am crucified with Christ. Really? When Jesus died,

**[32:12 - 32:20]** I died. That's what Paul meant. I am crucified. I was crucified with Christ on the cross of

**[32:20 - 32:31]** Calvary. Nevertheless, I live, but it's no longer I that lives. And it's Christ who lives in and

**[32:31 - 32:48]** through me. Tell somebody you must be born again with with other new birth. You cannot

**[32:49 - 33:03]** experience the kingdom of God. Now, the word kingdom there is not heaven. So just for you to know,

**[33:03 - 33:12]** this is just a side piece. I'm not speaking about heaven. He's not speaking because the things

**[33:13 - 33:25]** that this saw Jesus doing on earth, it was not, you know, that's what Jesus tells. Say what you

**[33:25 - 33:40]** pray pray, that kingdom, your rule come on earth as it is in heaven. So kingdom, look, look, look,

**[33:40 - 33:56]** look 17. Am I doing well with my time? Look 17, verse 20 to 21. My people, look 17. Yes,

**[33:56 - 34:11]** now when they ask about the Pharisees, when will the kingdom of God come? He said to them,

**[34:11 - 34:20]** the kingdom of God does not come by you observing rules and regulations, but you're doing things

**[34:23 - 34:35]** first one, first one, no, will they say, see it there. See it here. For indeed, the kingdom of God

**[34:35 - 34:48]** is where? It's inside. Say it's inside. And we are where? If you are not inside, you will not know.

**[34:53 - 35:10]** The kingdom of God is within you. Romans 14, verse 17. Paul says it this way. Romans 14, verse 17.

**[35:15 - 35:26]** You got it there. Righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost. Righteousness, peace and joy in the

**[35:26 - 35:37]** Holy Ghost, that's the kingdom of God. Righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost. Righteousness, peace

**[35:37 - 35:44]** and joy in the Holy Ghost, that's won't you be a part of the kingdom? Don't you be a part?

**[35:45 - 35:55]** Won't you be a part? Come on, come on everybody, there's joy in this kingdom child,

**[35:56 - 36:11]** there's peace. Come on everybody. So why would you want to stay in the nightclub? You want to

**[36:11 - 36:22]** continue being in that old way, old style of life? Paul says the kingdom of God. So when Jesus said

**[36:22 - 36:29]** except you be born again, you cannot experience, you cannot enter righteousness, you have nothing to

**[36:29 - 36:37]** understand about the righteousness of God that is in Christ Jesus. Your own righteousness is

**[36:37 - 36:47]** like filthy rice, but this righteousness is like giving to us from God. He who knew no sin,

**[36:48 - 37:05]** became sin that you and I can become the righteousness of who God. So I can fall a drop

**[37:06 - 37:23]** up. I'm in Jesus, I'm righteous. It is not my sinning that gives me my standing in righteousness. No,

**[37:23 - 37:35]** it's because of who he is and what he did that makes me righteous. Are you with me?

**[37:35 - 37:50]** Who? The Bible is unbelievable. Look, look, look, look. I think it's Proverbs 28 verse 1.

**[37:51 - 38:01]** The Bible says the righteous is as bold. So that's what they were saying. That's what

**[38:01 - 38:10]** Nicodemus and his crew were saying when Jesus had the audacity to whip people and he was not a priest.

**[38:11 - 38:16]** This is exuding righteousness, righteousness in the nation.

**[38:20 - 38:28]** And give you the authority to do the sins. Then on the Sabbath day he healing people.

**[38:33 - 38:40]** And then when he's teaching, he's teaching in that like, I just wrote reading, reading from another book,

**[38:43 - 38:57]** they call it the God of Book, the Torah or the Eucharist. Some rare book in a piece of

**[38:57 - 39:04]** what you're sorry, that's where I come from. The common prayer book, yeah. And it just every Sunday

**[39:04 - 39:15]** you come, that's the same common prayer. You don't have your own prayer. You can't generate.

**[39:17 - 39:23]** You say you in love with me, but every time you come to me, it is the same thing. The same thing

**[39:24 - 39:39]** down, oh great Father. Look, lift me alone. Oh, like a liar.

**[39:40 - 39:44]** Oh my, look, look, look. He stayed behind for Lazarus to die.

**[39:48 - 39:56]** And that cow said, you show me where you lay him. I said, but now he stinks, Lord.

**[39:57 - 40:11]** Just take me there. Move the stew. I believe people are beating people sweating.

**[40:11 - 40:18]** Well, what is he about to do it here? Someone said, if he had just said, come,

**[40:19 - 40:25]** every, every dead body. So you are very careful.

**[40:33 - 40:38]** Then there will be people here. You are dead. There are dead situations in your life.

**[40:39 - 40:47]** Dead relationships, dead businesses, those are Lazarus. I feel they're not in the house.

**[40:55 - 41:08]** I come from the dead in the name of Jesus. We go to the spirit of God. We go to the

**[41:08 - 41:17]** takes of God, that husband, that relationship, that person in your life. You'll be praying for

**[41:17 - 41:29]** that person to come alive in Jesus. We declare life in the name of Jesus. The eyes of the

**[41:29 - 41:39]** understanding will be enlightened. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. Glory be to God.

**[41:40 - 41:43]** Hallelujah. The righteous is what?

**[41:45 - 42:00]** Proverbs 15. I believe it's 29. The Lord is far from the wicked. But he is the prayers

**[42:00 - 42:08]** of the righteous. Hallelujah. The Lord hears the prayers of the righteous.

**[42:13 - 42:19]** In front of Lazarus grave. This is when he got there. He says, Lord, Father, I thank you.

**[42:21 - 42:35]** You hear me, how? Why should I be bold? If my God can answer me, every time I call to him in prayer,

**[42:35 - 42:44]** you think I will be playing young girl? That's what I said when I came to this country and saw

**[42:44 - 42:50]** American kids. Even when they go abroad and they're acting foolish, they got the backing

**[42:51 - 42:55]** of the government. They're doing something. Government send helicopter and take them out.

**[42:55 - 43:04]** Even when government comes to police, these guys will arrest you. They're on the highway.

**[43:04 - 43:09]** Then they put their vehicle butt in the traffic. You'll stop. You can't do nothing.

**[43:10 - 43:16]** They are backed by that bash, that uniform, that car, and they got the gun. You can't do nothing.

**[43:18 - 43:29]** They are backed by the government. It's not a war like being police. But as a hobby,

**[43:30 - 43:38]** I was not saved then. I did Michelin Street between Michelin Education and Finance Minister.

**[43:38 - 43:44]** That's on one way street. I don't know. I didn't grow up in like Banovia. I came to the other side

**[43:46 - 43:52]** with my mother's car and the police came. Put his hand. Oh man, you don't want to see me while

**[43:52 - 44:02]** not born again. Put the traffic. You speak to the police like that. Yeah, move man.

**[44:03 - 44:07]** Hey, miss, can't you see the sign and you can't see the sign? Do you know that's one way I said I

**[44:07 - 44:18]** do not know. Come, come, come, come, come. He came. I told you, that was before I became

**[44:26 - 44:37]** the righteous is as well. The prayer of the righteous, they are answered by God.

**[44:37 - 44:56]** Oh, and then they said the prayer. All right, the right prayer. Let me, let me read this. The

**[44:56 - 45:10]** effecture, fervent prayer of the righteous, the effective. He's not praying out of his head.

**[45:10 - 45:21]** He's such the scriptures and this is what God wants to do. And he prays God. He prays God's work.

**[45:22 - 45:32]** I was a young man when Bishop said this. If God spoke to you and told you there is a hold in the wall.

**[45:32 - 45:41]** He says, go all the way to the end of the room. Run with all of your might. You don't see the

**[45:41 - 45:51]** whole jump with all of it when you get there. The whole will become a whole. You are not doing it on

**[45:51 - 46:03]** your own accord. It's just like when he spoke to Moses and told him stretch forth. It looks so

**[46:03 - 46:11]** silly. It looks so unnatural. Ratsy will go through the ratsy and you imagine him,

**[46:11 - 46:15]** quarry with God and God telling him, shut up man. And just do what I'm telling you to do.

**[46:19 - 46:34]** Moses does it and the ratsy. Those are the type of things that the people around saw Jesus doing.

**[46:35 - 46:46]** And this man had to come by night to inquire who, who gives it to this. That's how we ought to live

**[46:46 - 46:59]** in this time, these end times. People should see signs and oneness. We know that you are on furlough.

**[46:59 - 47:07]** We know that it took away your, your whatever you, your employment. How are you making it?

**[47:12 - 47:25]** I believe in God. I have it like Jesus said. There another source of food that you do not know of.

**[47:26 - 47:43]** I have another means of supplying man without you knowing what to do that. You must be born again.

**[47:45 - 47:46]** Hallelujah.

**[47:47 - 48:03]** The steps of the righteous, the order of God. God, God indirect you. God will show you. You get

**[48:03 - 48:14]** to go to God in prayer. My wife was supposed to come. She was supposed to come to the

**[48:15 - 48:21]** find a hill yesterday. She didn't come. So we'll come into there. She said, I want to tell you

**[48:21 - 48:28]** something. You know, so I was listening to this man of God and the man of God said, we should think

**[48:28 - 48:36]** this way. She said, she was trying to come up with something, how to teach her children at her

**[48:36 - 48:50]** school. She's an elementary school teacher because in the sounds of the alphabet, how to let us

**[48:51 - 48:57]** can make it. So for how to introduce it. She said, so when I heard I met talking,

**[48:57 - 49:04]** I said, the reason why I didn't do anything in the house, I couldn't get, is I wash all the different,

**[49:04 - 49:12]** different people doing theirs, but there was just something different. She said, all of a sudden,

**[49:12 - 49:18]** the spirit of God gave me an idea. When she said the idea, I said, look, if we develop the team,

**[49:18 - 49:27]** we can come again, we've come a million years. So I mean, she's telling me this story. I'm not a child,

**[49:27 - 49:34]** but all of a sudden, this child like happiness just came up. I said, look, I already won't come to

**[49:34 - 49:51]** your class. I said, he leads you. He shows you things to this. This is the life we have our personal GPS.

**[49:51 - 50:12]** We are led, we are spirit led. Those who are sons of God, they are led by the spirit. So if you are here,

**[50:12 - 50:23]** you're not, you're not born again. It's about time that you left that old duplicate

**[50:23 - 50:38]** machine. If you struggling with habits that came from the Adamic line, it can be killed in Jesus

**[50:40 - 50:53]** through your exercising of your faith. Hallelujah. Born, born, born again. Thank God I'm born again.

**[50:53 - 51:06]** Born, born, born again. Born again. Born again. Born, born. Thank God.

**[51:06 - 51:19]** Born again. Thank God I'm born again. For those of you that left us to score, I tell you,

**[51:20 - 51:35]** born of the what I am, spirit and the blood. I thank God. I did not listen to you. I would have been

**[51:37 - 51:47]** by now Aslan who have killed me. By now poverty will have put me on the side. But where I am,

**[51:48 - 51:56]** you all cannot even figure out how someone who did not, did not graduate, how come

**[51:56 - 52:11]** he is where he is? It is because of this new life. Hallelujah. So if you are sitting,

**[52:12 - 52:21]** and you came this morning, and you have never given your life to Jesus before,

**[52:21 - 52:39]** said may not, the time is now. It's about time that you'll be born. Thank you.

Just as the angel said "unto you" to the shepherds, You say "unto you" to me. I refuse to exclude myself from Your promises. Though You love the whole world, You also love me individually and personally. I receive You, I take possession of You, I appropriate You, and I will begin to enjoy the fullness of all that You are. Jesus, You are MY Savior, MY Lord, MY answer, MY breakthrough, MY everything. Holy Spirit, help me unwrap the gift of Jesus so I can truly see what I have. Give me revelation upon revelation of His love, power, and presence. The greater my revelation of who He is, the greater my joy will be.</p>

      <div class="prayer-points">
        <div class="scripture-glass">
          <p class="scripture-text">Father, I thank You that Your word is sure. For 5,000 years You promised "He will come," then after 400 years of silence, "He has come." Over 400 prophecies fulfilled to the letter. What You spoke thousands of years earlier came to pass exactly as promised. I'm in a season where I've heard from You but now there's silence. It seems like You've forgotten. But this story encourages me and builds my faith. No word of Yours is void of power. No word of Yours will return void. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Your word not to come to pass. Has He said it? Then He WILL do it. I will not doubt what You've said during the years of silence. I will go back and remind myself of what is written. Your word was true in Genesis and it's true in 2025. What You promised me WILL come to pass. This day You are my Savior. This day You are my Lord. This day You are working in my life.</p>

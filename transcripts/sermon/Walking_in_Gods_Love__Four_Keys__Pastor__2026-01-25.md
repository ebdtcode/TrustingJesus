## Sermon Summary

This powerful message continues a series on God's unfailing love, focusing specifically on how believers can practically walk in and experience God's love daily. Building on previous teaching about eternal life as the present reality that gives believers the capacity to love, the pastor presents four essential keys (the "Four A's") for walking in God's love.

The sermon emphasizes that eternal life is not merely a future promise but God's very life, nature, and ability imparted to the believer's spirit at salvation. This divine life energizes the spirit to function as God designed, particularly in the area of love. The message makes clear that believers don't need to try harder to love but rather need to learn how to release and walk in the love already present within them through the Holy Spirit.

## Full Transcript

Now we want to focus your attention on the Word. We've been ministering over the last several weeks, again, on this unfailing love that we have received from God and that we're walking in this year. And last week, we talked about the capacity to love. We're called by God to love one another, even as Jesus loves us. And the question is, where do we get that capacity from?

And so we spent a lot of time last week talking to you about eternal life and helping you to understand what eternal life is. And we said that eternal life is not a promise for the future after you die, but that eternal life is a present reality that every believer receives when he accepts Christ as his Lord and Savior.

We told you that eternal life points to the very life nature and ability of God, imparted to your human spirit when you became born again. And that this eternal life is what energizes your spirit to be able to function as God has designed to function, to walk in love as God designed to walk in love, and to be conformed to the very image of Jesus in all of His expressions.

The power of your spirit to do all that God desires or designed to do is, in fact, the eternal life, the life of God, that you receive through your faith in Jesus at salvation. So **1 John 5:11** was our foundation of Scripture. And that verse said, and this is the record, or this is the testimony, God has given us eternal life. And this life is in His Son.

So if you have received Jesus Christ as your Savior, this is your reality. You have received eternal life. On the inside of you is the very life of God. On the inside of you is the very life of the Son of God. Inside of you is the very spirit of life. And it is this life in your spirit that is energizing your spirit to be able to do everything and anything that God calls you to do.

So when God says to you, walk in love, and when Jesus says, love one another as He loves us, it is because He has already created within us the capacity to do so, that capacity being found in this precious eternal life that now dwells on the inside of us.

### Understanding Eternal Life

So always think of eternal life as God's life inside of you, regard it as the divine energy or force that God has put in your spirit, that fuels your spirit, energizes your spirit, and makes it able to function in the likeness of Christ. Say hallelujah.

Just like biological life in your body enables your body to function and do what it was designed to do, what biological life does for your body, eternal life does for your spirit. So God's life, God's nature, God's ability inside of you allows your spirit to function in accordance to the likeness of Christ.

What gasoline does for a car, what jet fuel does for an airplane, eternal life does for your spirit. What the human blood does for my physical body, eternal life does for my spirit.

Settle this in your mind. Settle this in your heart. Whatever God requires of you, God makes you able to do through the gift of eternal life. This eternal life flows in your spirit. And just like blood flows through your physical body, this eternal life is flowing through your spiritual veins and arteries as it were, delivering strength and ability, God's strength, God's ability to every spiritual organ.

This eternal life gives your spiritual ears the ability to hear. Your spiritual eyes, the ability to see, your mouth, the ability to speak words of life, spiritually. This eternal life gives your spiritual nostrils, your organ of discernment, the ability to discern. All of these are part of your human spirit and it is God's life that quickens and makes them function.

And thank God that life was received at salvation. You therefore have the capacity to love even as Christ loves. The Scripture says that the love of God has actually been shed abroad in your spiritual heart. And so your heart, your spiritual heart overflows with the love of God and all the love that you need to walk in is already present on the inside of you waiting to be released.

### Moving to Practical Application

And so with that behind us, I want to focus now our attention on what's next. Now that I know I have this God-given capacity to walk in love because I am a partaker of God's nature through the gift of eternal life, what's next?

The Scripture says in **1 John 3:14**, we know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. You know, I find myself loving my brothers and sisters, I really do. And what this verse tells me is the fact that I'm loving my brothers and sisters as I do is proof that I have the life of God in me because that kind of love is produced only by the life of God. And so the nature of God's life in you is love. The natural expression of God's life in you is love for the brothers. Thank God.

So God has done this part. He set us up to succeed. He's given you everything you need to literally walk in the likeness of Christ and to walk in love towards one another even as Christ has loved us. Hallelujah.

### Four Keys to Walking in God's Love Daily

Now here where we want to become very practical. I want to now help you live this out on a daily basis. I want to share with you four keys that will show you how to walk in God's love and experience its full effect in your life on a daily basis. And these keys are straight from the Scriptures and none of them is difficult, but each of them is important. And I'm going to use four A's. Each of these keys will start with an A to help you remember and to help you recall.

## KEY #1: AWARENESS

And so here's key number one. If I am going to walk in God's love daily, I want to experience its full effect, having received this eternal life and this love from God. The first key is **awareness**. I need to become aware of the presence of God and of the love of God and of how much God loves me. That awareness is critical. I need to see how much God loves me. I need a revelation concerning the love of God.

Ignorance of God's love is a huge hindrance to walking in God's love. And so this is critical. Having received the life of God and the love of God on the inside of you, if you are unaware of this, it's like sleeping in a freezing apartment. And we know this weekend is going to be quite cold. It's going to be freezing.

Can you imagine being in an apartment without heat and you're freezing in that apartment this weekend. And the reason you're freezing is because you don't know that heat is available to you. You don't know that. It's available but you don't know that.

I shared this because this happened to me and Pastor Chris many years ago in 1990 or 1991 when we were here, had just started the church. And we moved to our first apartment. And I remember the first one or two days. It was cold and we slept on the floor. We were happy we had a mattress. We didn't have a bed then. And I remember she and I bundling up with as many blankets as we could because even though there was heat in the apartment, we were not aware of that because where we had moved from, the heat was not controlled by the resident. It was determined or controlled by the apartment managers and they would at some point in the year turn on the heat.

And so we assumed it was cold in that apartment because they hadn't turned on the heat. When in fact, there was a thermostat on the wall and we could have had we known and been aware of the reality of the heat that was present, we could have had a much more comfortable night.

So hear me, if you are not aware of the love of God and how great God's love is for you, you're going to end up freezing unnecessarily. Critical. We need to become aware of how much God loves us and we need to grow in that awareness. Our revelation of the presence, the power of God's love already at work in our lives need to continually increase.

### How to Grow in Awareness

And so how do you do that? One of the things you need to do is to begin to pray. Begin to pray daily that the Holy Spirit will literally increase your awareness and your revelation of the love of God that is present in your life. **Pray for the increase of revelation.**

An example of that is in **Ephesians 3:19**. And in Ephesians 3:19, the Apostle Paul himself is praying and this is how Paul prayed for the saints. He says that you may know the love of God or the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge. So there's a clear example where Paul was praying that the Holy Spirit will increase the revelation of the love of God to the saints.

So begin to pray that for yourself but don't just pray that for yourself. Pray that for your brothers, your sisters. Let's all pray that for one another that God will continually by His Spirit increase the revelation, our awareness of the love of God that is present and of the power of that love that we already have.

And also connected to prayer is a passage of scripture in the book of **Jude**. I believe it begins at verse 20. And Jude says to the Christians, he says, but you dearly beloved, that is loved by God. You people who are loved by God. He says building up your most holy faith, pray in the Holy Ghost, keep yourself in the love of God.

And so clearly the Apostle is saying that one of the things that we ought to do and we should do that keeps us in the love of God is to **pray in the Spirit**. And so I encourage you, pray with your understanding. Ask for increase in knowledge and revelation on a daily basis for yourself and others concerning God's love. But then add this extra dimension of praying in the Spirit because the scripture says when you pray in the Spirit you are building yourself up in your most holy faith. And you are literally keeping yourself in the love of God. Hallelujah.

And then here's one more thing that you need to do on a daily basis in order to increase your awareness of God's love and power. You need to **read and meditate on scripture**. We spend so many sermons and we will keep reminding you of how important it is that you read and you meditate on the scriptures. The scriptures that in particular when it comes to love, the scriptures that talk of God's love for all of His children, not just to you but God's love for all of His children including you. Amen.

Learn to read and meditate. Let me just give you one or two examples of what I'm talking about. You know Jesus said that as the Father has loved Him so He has loved us (**John 15:9**). As the Father has loved Him Jesus, I love you. Quoting Jesus. I also have loved you and abide in my love.

Now think about that. And then meditate upon it. You know how much God loves Jesus. I mean, there's an absolute love. God said of Jesus, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." I mean, Jesus is the love of God's heart. Hallelujah. And humanly speaking, we cannot conceive that God would love us as much as He loves Jesus, but that's exactly what Jesus is saying.

Now we need to meditate upon that and let that truth keep growing on the inside of our hearts and keep renewing our minds that God loves us to this degree and that Jesus loves us to this degree. So here Jesus says that He loves us as much as the Father loves Him.

And then in another passage in **John 16:27** Jesus says that the Father Himself loves you. My goodness. Spend a lot of time. Not just once in a while. Spend a lot of time meditating on these scriptures, praying for deeper revelation. And these passages would become even more and more real to you. Hallelujah.

Now look at another scripture that you can meditate upon. Pray that God will help you understand the love of the Father, praying in the Spirit, but then meditate on the scriptures. **John 3:16** says, "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

Look at those words. God so loved. And that is pointing to the extreme nature of God's love for us. Amen. He loved us to this degree that He would give His only begotten Son for us.

Think about it. What Father, what Mother would love someone else so much that He or She will be willing to give His or her child for the sake of this other person, especially a person who has shown no regard for them. No one would do that. It doesn't make sense. It does not make sense yet. This is exactly what God did for us.

God was willing to give His only begotten Son, the Son of His love for us, shows you how extreme is His love for us, and how extreme is the value that He attaches to us. Wow. It makes no sense. No human sense. There is no explanation I could ever give that could be rational in any of our minds that would justify a Father giving away or giving His Son, giving up His Son for someone else.

It's a kind of love that is beyond human understanding and comprehension, but that's the kind of love that God has for us. A love that we can only stand amazed at. We cannot comprehend it fully. We can only marvel at it. We can be overwhelmed by it. We can be full of gratitude because of it. Amen.

Our response is not analysis because no matter how much we analyze, it'll never make sense, but we can stand in awe. We can feel gratitude and we can surrender completely to this kind of love.

That's just two examples of many scriptures that point to the love of God for Jesus and the love of God for us, and if we would pray and pray in the Spirit and meditate on those passages, our awareness of God's love will increase. The revelation of God's love will become deeper and that will have a huge impact on our ability to literally walk in love and to experience God's love in a practical, daily manner that will be far more fulfilling than we would even hope to enjoy without that revelation.

## KEY #2: ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Here's the second key. Now that I am beginning to grow in my awareness of God's love and that will continue to increase as I pray and meditate, the second key to walking in God's love and experiencing its effect fully in my life is to **acknowledge** that which I have become aware of.

In other words, it's important for us not only to be aware of these things, it's critical for us to daily, often acknowledge our agreement with what the word of God has to say concerning God's love for us and for His children. It's important that we not only become aware but that we confess our agreement with what the word of God says concerning His love for us.

The book of **Philemon, verse 6**, it only has one chapter, says that our faith becomes effective or effectual by the acknowledgement of every good thing that we have in Christ Jesus. Well, one of the good things we have in Christ Jesus is the love of God, the life of Christ in us, the love of Christ already present in our lives is one of the good things. In fact, the best thing we have and the Scripture says, we need to acknowledge those things that we have received.

So it's very, very important that we open our mouths and we begin to confess our agreement with what the Scriptures have said and what the Holy Spirit has shown us concerning God's love for us. Don't be silent because our confession activates what grace or what love has provided.

Awareness must be followed by agreement, by our vocal acknowledgement of what Christ has done and of the love of God that now dwells on the inside of us.

And just like I said earlier, if you have heat but you're not aware of it, you can freeze. You can become aware of it and still freeze if you never turn the thermostat on. You can have all of these new electrical appliances, your refrigerator, your TV, your stove and your air conditioning, all of these things that operate on electricity and you will benefit from none of them if you don't flip the switch.

### Flipping the Switch

So the acknowledgement of the love of God in you and the acknowledgement of the life of God in you, the confession of that with your mouth is how you flip the switch. Amen? So you must follow your awareness, accompany your awareness with acknowledging with your mouth, with agreeing with your mouth, with confessing with your mouth what Christ has done and the love of God that resides in you, the life of Christ that is working in you. Hallelujah.

If you choose not to turn on the electric switch in your home, none of your appliances will work and if you choose not to open your mouth and begin to acknowledge and confess the love of God and the life of God on the inside of you, establishing and declaring your agreement with that, then your spirit will never be able to experience or love to the degree it is capable of.

Unless I'm willing to release the life in my spirit and release the love in my spirit with the words of my mouth, my spirit will not be able to function as God designed it to function. It will not love to the degree it is capable of. Hallelujah.

So let me repeat, if you want your spirit to function in love, to bring your body in submission to the love of God, then you have to turn the switch of love on with your confession. Always be declaring what the word says concerning the reality of His love for you.

This is where you begin to declare what God says is true even when your feelings disagree. Amen. Remember love is not trying to enter your life. It's already in your spirit. In abundance. It's waiting to be released and your confession, your acknowledgement, your vocal agreement is the key to releasing that love that is already present in your spirit so that your spirit can be able to function on the energy that God has placed on the inside of it, releasing that which is inside of the spirit into your mind, into your body, into your life. Hallelujah.

Now listen to me. **What you agree with, you activate.** So when you say God loves me, you're activating the love of God. When you say God's love is in me, you're activating God's love. When you say His love is working through me, you're activating God's love to work through you. Hallelujah.

You're not making something true. You are simply releasing what is already true. You're giving, maybe I could say this, you're giving your spirit permission to release its contents. Amen. That love that is in it, you're giving your spirit permission to release its contents. That life that is in it. You're giving your spirit permission to release that life when you open your mouth and begin to acknowledge and agree with the love of God and the life of God and what the word has to say regarding that.

So don't keep your mouth silent. Become aware. As you're becoming aware, accompany that awareness with acknowledgement, with agreement, with confession in Jesus.

## KEY #3: ABIDING

And guess here's key number three and key number three is **abiding**. So first, become aware and keep growing in your awareness of God's love. Two, open your mouth to acknowledge that love on the inside of you. Its greatness, its power, its availability, its presence. Confess your agreement with that word, with that love that is already there.

Now third, Jesus said in **John 15:9** and this is very important. I referred to this earlier: as the Father loves me, I also have loved you. Then He says **abide in my love**. And so that's the third A: abiding in the love of Christ.

Become aware of it, keep growing in that awareness, acknowledge it, keep acknowledging it, keep agreeing with it, keep confessing your agreement. Now Jesus says to us abide in my love.

Now this is a key that is simple but very, very life changing and transforming. Now notice Jesus did not say try harder to love. He did not say work harder to love. He did not say put more effort, use more of your strength to love. He simply said abide in my love.

So one of the most important keys to experiencing God's love personally, to walking in love consistently is learning how to abide in His love. Now if I were to say to you that this is where I abide, I would be saying this is where I live. This is where I stay and this is where you can find me. This is where you can find me. I abide here.

And so when Jesus is saying to us abiding my love, He's saying basically the same thing. He's saying listen, you received the revelation of my love that I love you as much as the Father loves me. Now you need to stay there. You need to remain there. You need to live in that revelation. You should never allow anything to move you from this position.

### Staying in the Revelation

As you are receiving the revelation of God's love, you make a decision that you are going to stay right there. You're not going to allow any pressure, any problems, any person to cause you to doubt the love that Jesus has for you or to doubt the love the Father has for you. Abiding in that revelation.

In fact, the Amplified Version in translating this tells us instead of abiding in the love is do not doubt God's love. And that's what abiding is. Now that you're becoming aware, do not ever allow yourself to doubt the love of God for you.

And you know, you will be tempted to doubt. There will be times when it will seem like God doesn't love you. But that's not true. Make up your mind. You're going to stay. You're going to remain. You're going to be anchored. You're going to live in this revelation and nothing is going to remove you from this position. That God loves you and that Jesus loves you as much as the Father loves Him.

Make that your permanent position as you relate to God and as you deal with circumstances. Hallelujah. Don't focus on anything other as your foundation than this matter of God's love for you. Let that love be your dwelling place. Not somewhere that you visit occasionally from time to time. You visit the love and then you steer away from it and then maybe you come back. No, no, be permanently positioned in this revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. That's where you live.

Abiding is not trying harder to love. Jesus never told us to produce love. He told us to simply abide in love. Rest in His love. Remain in His love. Stay anchored in His love.

### Practical Abiding - Total Reliance

And so begin to think about abiding as relying totally on the love of God for you. Amen. Think about when you hear the word abide, think about okay, I need to stay here and I need to rely totally upon the love of God for me.

For all of my answers to prayer, I'm not relying on myself. I'm not relying on anybody else. I'm not relying on my performance. I am abiding in the love of God. I'm relying on the love of God. And I'm declaring that God loves me too much that His love will never allow Him not to help me.

His love for me is so great. It will never permit Him not to respond. God cannot not intervene in my situation for my good because His love for me is so great. It will not permit Him not to get involved. Again, reverently I say, God cannot help but get involved because His love is just that intense. Rely on that love. That is abiding. Rely on that love for all your answers to prayer.

And then rely on that love that is in you. That love He's put in you. Rely upon it for your ability to love others. You know, sometimes it's tough to love people. So don't rely on your own love because your own love will fail you. Hallelujah. But rely on, you're aware of the love of God. You're declaring it. Now, abide. Rely on the love of God inside of you as the source of your love or the source of your ability to love others as He is.

Think of abiding as refusing to take your eyes off of His love but to depend upon that love and depend upon Him to love through you. Refuse to take your eyes off of His love. Refuse to take your eyes off of Him. Instead, depend upon His love in you and depend on Him to love through you.

### What Abiding Looks Like

So practically what that looks like. It looks like this. It's very simple. Instead of saying, "I must be more loving," which puts all of this demand upon yourself to come up with enough love. You learn to say, "Lord, I'm not able to love as You love. So I'm depending on Your love in me right now. Lord I am dependent upon You right now to love this person through me."

It's as simple as getting up in the morning and that's abiding. It's as simple as getting up in the morning saying, "Father, thank You that You love me the same way You love Jesus. I receive this love today. I rely on this love today totally." That's abiding.

When pressure comes or when people are difficult and we know how that can be and we ourselves can be those who bring pressure and at times we're difficult. Amen. But when you find yourself in those kinds of circumstances dealing with those types of people. Instead of forcing yourself to try to love them, you can pause and you can inwardly say a prayer: "Lord, I cannot do this in my own strength. I'm abiding in Your love. I rely on Your love in me right now to flow through me to this person. I'm depending upon You Lord right now to love this person or to cause Your love in me to flow from me to him or her."

Hallelujah. That's abiding. Practically speaking, you're relying on Him.

When you feel empty or dry and sometimes you will, you don't condemn yourself. You return to the source and you say, "Lord, fill me again with Your love. Lord, reveal to me again how much Your love is." You go back to the source. You meditate and you receive a fresh revelation or a renewal of that revelation you've already received in the past. For some reason you've taken your mind off. You return to the source and you say, "Lord, once again, I lean on You."

That's abiding. Not striving, not pretending, but literally depending upon Him every day, every moment of the day for His love to work for you and work through you. And when you fail and when you depart, you don't get into condemnation. You simply return to your source and once again, choose to depend on Him. Hallelujah. Amen.

You don't love others for God. You love others through God. Hallelujah. And so whenever you miss it, don't try to do it in your strength, resort to your own ability. Just return to your reliance, return to your dependence upon the One who is the source on the inside of you.

## KEY #4: ACTION

Then lastly, as I bring this to a close, here is key number four. You've learned to be aware. You've learned to acknowledge. You've learned to abide by relying. And now here's the final step. All of this love that has come to you and that you have received from God needs to also flow through you to others. Amen.

You need to decide to love others in tangible ways as you are loved by Christ. And so our fourth key is the decision to **act** in loving ways towards others. Fourth key is action. A decision I make and you make to act in loving ways to others. A decision I make to allow the love of God in me to flow through me in tangible ways to others.

And here's the scripture that supports that. **John 15:12** reads, "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."

This is Jesus's new commandment. The old commandment, the greatest was love one another as you love yourself but He has made it even greater. Raised the bar by saying that now I want you to love one another as I've loved you.

And since Jesus loves us more than we love ourselves, this is a higher love that we're called to in the new covenant than in the old. Now that should immediately reveal to you what Jesus is actually intending here. Since we know that this is a commandment that we cannot fulfill in ourselves, no human being has the strength or ability to love others as much as Jesus has loved them. This immediately calls us to attention that what Christ is wanting to do here is for us to turn to Him to allow Him to love through us.

### Letting Love Flow

When He says love as I have loved, He's really saying, well, how's that going to happen? The answer is you can do it if you allow me to love others through you. So what is Jesus asking for here? He's really asking us to take action and the action we need to take is to allow His love to flow through us. It's to allow Him to love others through us.

And of course that has to do again with presenting ourselves to Him in faith, believing that He Himself is love. He lives in us and He will actually work through us. Amen. And so again that's why it's critical that we become aware, we acknowledge and we learn to abide because if we don't become aware, if we don't start acknowledging, if we don't learn how to abide, we will try to do this in our strength and we will fail.

But if we're aware and we're acknowledging and we're abiding, then the love that will flow through us will not be forced. It will be a flow. It will flow freely. It will flow naturally through us.

But this action, this love in action, is practical and it will manifest itself in practical ways. You see when you're abiding in Him and acknowledging His love and becoming more and more aware of His love, His love in you will flow. He will be able to work easily through you and love easily through you. His love will flow. Patience will flow. Kindness will flow. Mercy will flow through you. All of these things that are called the fruit of the Spirit will start to flow through you in very practical and tangible ways.

But if you disconnect from the revelation of His love and you're just trying to do it as a commandment, without first receiving the love of God, you're not going to be able to give that love. Amen. So if you become disconnected to that revelation, then you're going to find yourself becoming easily irritable, defensive, harsh, withdrawn, unable to forgive people because you have in some way disconnected yourself from the revelation, not from His love but from the revelation of that love, which you need in order to walk in it. Amen.

So once again, remember that these acts of love are not forced. You need to allow this love to flow and the way you do it again is by learning how to abide, moment by moment, learn to simply say, "Lord, love this person through me. Lord speak through me. Lord respond through me."

### Practical Examples of Action

Learn to say, "Lord by the power of Your love which is in me, that love which is energizing my spirit with love, I extend forgiveness to my brother. In the same way as You've extended forgiveness to me." That's action. You're allowing Christ to love through you. You made a decision that you're going to respond in a tangible loving way to others. Now you're letting His love flow through you, you're letting Him love through you, and again, your words are involved.

"Lord, by the power of Your love which is in me, which is energizing now my spirit with that very love, I extend forgiveness to my brother and to my sisters."

By the way, if there are people that you haven't forgiven, or if you're struggling with forgiveness, that's a very, very important issue because it has serious spiritual implications for your own life and you don't want to give the enemy that kind of place.

So I want to encourage you, if you find it hard to forgive and release people, it is because you're not abiding in the love of God, in the revelation of God's love for you and for them. You see, it's not that God loves you alone, guess what? God loves that other person.

And so begin to abide in that revelation: "This person that I can't stand, this person that I won't talk to, this person that I refuse to forgive. This person is loved by God as much as He loves Jesus." Wow. "This person God loves as much as He loves Jesus."

When you're saying that, you're abiding in the love of God, the revelation. Amen. And the more you're able to see and acknowledge that God loves that person as much as He loves Jesus, something will happen in your own heart. Amen. God loves that person as much as He loves me. If God loves that person as much as He loves Jesus, who am I to withhold my love from that person or withhold God's love from flowing through me.

But it's very critical that you don't allow the love of God for you to become trapped, so to speak, in your spirit and not flow through you because you have not made the decision to forgive others through Christ and the strength He gives you. Hallelujah.

### Summary and Application

Now these are, you know, things that I trust will help you. We hope that you heard something today that now you can begin to put into practice. This revelation of the capacity that you have to walk and be as Christ and love as Christ, for your spirit to function in a Christ-like manner is present in you through the gift of eternal life.

And that now you can literally begin to walk in that love because that love of God is already in you. And all you need to do now is to flip the switch of love and switch on the switch of faith and then become aware and grow in that awareness. Start acknowledging with your mouth that love regardless of your feelings is real.

You hear me, learn to abide. Rely on that love in you for everything. And then make a decision to act and let this love flow through you, to let Christ love people through you in very, very practical ways.

And you know that love looks like serving others. That love is going to manifest itself in terms of forgiveness for others. That love is going to manifest itself in terms of your spirit of generosity and your giving. That love is going to manifest in the way you talk, the smile, how you talk to people, the words you use in very, very practical daily ways. Christ will be revealed through you.

And every time you love you're making God Himself more and more visible to the world. And the scripture has declared, this is how the world will know about Jesus and know that you're truly His disciples by your love. That is by the love that you're allowing to flow out of you to others in Jesus' name.

### Putting It All Together

All right. Well, let's end by putting it all together. Amen. Christ lives in you. Christ has given you the capacity to love yourself and to love other Christians. And here are the four keys. And let's say together:

**The first key is AWARENESS.** Repeat after me, say: "I see how much God loves me. And I continue to grow every day in my awareness of that love." Amen. I continue to grow each day in the awareness of that love.

**Second is ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.** All right. Say with me: "I agree with and confess what God says about His love for all of His children, including me." Hallelujah.

**The third key is ABIDING.** Say with me: "I rely on His love for me. I rely on His love in me for everything. For everything, I rely on His love for every answer to prayer. I rely on His love for the ability to love others as Christ loves me."

And then **the last is ACTION.** Say with me: "I allow His love to flow freely through me to others. I allow Christ to love through me. Freely I receive and freely I give. I have freely received love. I freely give love in Jesus' name." Amen. Amen.

### Closing Prayer and Invitation

Well, that brings that sermon to an end. I trust that you have been blessed and helped. May the Lord indeed open your eyes to see His immeasurable love that He has for you. May the Lord teach you to rest, rely and abide in His love. May the Lord help you to allow that same love that you're receiving to flow through you to a world that is in need. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.

If you're watching and you have not received that love because you have not received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, I want to encourage you this day right where you are, bow your head and say to Jesus:

"Jesus, I thank You for the love You have for me. I am a sinner. I cannot save myself. And I certainly cannot love as You have loved me. Today, I confess that I need You. I need You as Savior. I need You as Lord. And today, I receive You as my Savior and as my Lord. Thank You for giving Your life for me. And today by faith, I accept Your life in me. Now abide the power of Your life in me and the power of Your love at work in me, conforming me to Your image in Jesus' name. Amen."

If that's the first time you prayed that prayer or if you have felt separated from God, I want you to know that having prayed the prayer we just prayed, that prayer of faith in which you confess Christ as your Savior and your Lord, all of your sins have been forgiven. And if truly your confession of Jesus as Lord has done something eternally significant for you, Christ has come into your heart. You now possess the life of Christ.

Now begin to grow in your awareness of that life and love. Start to acknowledge it with your lips and with your words. Learn to rely on that life and love always that is inside of you. And then let that love flow through you so that you too are walking in love towards others. In Jesus' name, amen.
